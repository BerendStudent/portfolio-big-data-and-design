Destination was Santiago de Los Caballeros, with nine tourists on board. On the return flight, at approximately 70 miles northwest of the Punta Cana Airport, the captain decided to fly to the La Romana Airport (the alternate airport), to refuel because he did not perform this operation at the Cibao Airport and because the fuel quantity indicator in the left tank was inoperative. He had doubts about the remaining fuel in the tanks. On the way to the alternate airport, the no.1 engine failed. The captain attempt to to restart the engine but this failed. Engine no. 2 was still running. The pilot, aware that the fault that turned off engine no.1 was the lack of fuel, made the decision to land in a sugarcane field near El Prado, located in the province of El Seybo, for fear that the remaining engine would also go out, perhaps without a suitable place to land later. Given these conditions, the captain chose a segment of a lane in the middle of two cane fields, where he made the emergency landing. The surface of this trail was not totally flat. After having a landing run of about 100 feet, the nose wheel collided with a stone, breaking the nose landing gear. Directional control was lost and the aircraft turned to the left, entering a cane field.;17:20;Britten-Norman BN-2A-26 Islander;Caribair, S.A.;Thursday 7 February 2008

Dark, night time conditions existed at the time of the accident.
The ATR-42-600, operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri and registered PK-TNJ, was parked at stand B-1 on the north apron of Halim Airport and was to be moved from the north to the south apron. For this the aircraft had to cross the active runway.
A towing car was used with a driver and one supporting personnel. Two engineers occupied the pilot seats in the aircraft. The engineers were assigned to apply aircraft brakes if required during the towing process.
The towed aircraft was towed without aircraft electrical power fed to the system and the navigation light, strobe light and the aircraft radio communications were off. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was performed by a handheld radio communication on frequency 152.7 MHz.
At 19:45 local time flight ID7703 requested pushback clearance to the Halim Tower controller on frequency 118.6 MHz. The aircraft was parked on parking stand B-2 and was approved to push back. 
After the ID7703 completed the pushback, the towing car driver of the towed aircraft requested clearance to Halim Tower Control Unit to reposition from parking stand B-1 to the south apron. The towing car driver was instructed to follow ID7703 and to report when on taxiway C. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was handled by the assistant controller.
The controller heard the communication between the assistant and towing car driver, he recognized the position of the towed aircraft was on the parking stand B-1. 
The ID7703 flight crew did not know that there was a towing aircraft behind as communications with the car were on a different frequency. At 19:48, ID7703 received taxi clearance to runway 24 via taxiway C.
At 19:50, the controller instructed ID7703 to hold on taxiway C due to an arriving aircraft. The assistant stated that when ID7703 was holding on short taxiway C, the towing car began moving the ATR-42.
At 19:53, ID7703 received clearance from controller to enter runway 24 to back track for departure. The aircraft that had just arrived would use parking stand B-1. Therefore, the assistant controller instructed the towing car driver to expedite the tow and report when on taxiway C. The controller was not observing the ATR at that time. The towing car was about to enter taxiway C at that time.
At 19:56, ID7703 reported ready for takeoff. The controller did not see any vehicle or object on the runway then issued clearance for takeoff. The pilot stated that during line up, the lights surrounding the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision for a short time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the threshold runway 24.
After receiving the takeoff clearance, the Second in Command (SIC) as pilot flying (PF) opened the power and pressed the Take Off / Go Around (TOGA) button.
The towing car driver stated that, when he saw ID7703 was lining up for takeoff, he asked Halim Tower whether ID7703 was initiating the takeoff. There was no reply from Halim Tower. The towing car driver then sped up the towing and turned to the right side of the runway.
When ID7703 was accelerating through approximate 80 knots, the SIC saw an object warned the captain. The pilots could not identify the object but later on when the object became closer, the SIC realized that there was an aircraft.
The captain took over control and applied the right rudder towards the right side of runway centerline and maintained a course between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The PIC intended to reject the takeoff shortly after they felt an impact. The impact occurred at a ground speed of about 130 knots, after passing V1. The pilot rejected takeoff and the aircraft stopped at approximately 400 meter from the towed aircraft which stopped at the left of the runway 24 centerline at approximately 100 meters from taxiway G.
The captain noticed fire on the left wing tip and immediately shut down both engines, activated the fire extinguishers of both engines and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and commanded to the flight attendant ""evacuation from the right"".
The flight attendants opened all aircraft passenger doors and the escape slides deployed. Most of passengers were evacuated from the left forward door (L1).
Both aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no reported injuries to the accident. 
The outer portion of the left wing of the Boeing 737, about 5,75 m, was severed. The ATR-42s left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine, was severed, along with the entire empennage.";19:55;ATR 42-600;TransNusa Aviation Mandiri;Monday 4 April 2016

The flight was operated by Transair but conducted on behalf of Aero-Tropics Air Services. Aero-Tropics would provide ground handling, pilot briefing facilities and marketing services. Transair provided the airplane and crew.
The Metro 23 aircraft departed Cairns at 08:31. During the descent to Lockhart River on the northbound flight, the crew intended to perform a runway 30 RNAV (GNSS) approach. Late in the approach, the crew appropriately manoeuvred the aircraft to land on runway 12. The engines were shutdown at 09:50. The aircraft departed Lockhart River at 09:58 and arrived at Bamaga at 10:39. The aircraft was refuelled at Bamaga for the return flight to Cairns via Lockhart River to collect two passengers. The pilot in command commented to the ground agent prior to departing Bamaga that the weather was 'bad' at Lockhart River and it may not be possible to land there. The forecast conditions at the aerodrome included a broken10 cloud base 1,000 ft above the aerodrome for periods of up to 60 minutes. The aircraft departed Bamaga at 11:07 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL170. Descent was commenced at 11:32. Three minutes later the copilot advised Brisbane ATC that the aircraft was on descent, passing 10,000 ft AMSL with an estimated time of arrival at Lockhart River of 11:38. At 11:39 the copilot broadcast on the CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency) that the crew was conducting the runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach, and that the aircraft was at the 'Whisky Golf' (LHRWG) waypoint and tracking for the 'Whisky India' (LHRWI) waypoint. At 11:41 the airplane was over the LHRWI intermediate fix and descent was recommenced at 4.8 NM from the LHRWF waypoint. This was 3.1 NM before the descent point specified on the approach chart for the 3.49 degree constant angle approach path to the missed approach point. After levelling briefly at 3000 feet 18 degrees of flaps were selected. The aircraft then commenced descent 1.4 NM before the final approach fix (FAF). This was 0.3 NM (approximately 7 seconds) after the descent point specified for the constant angle approach path. The average rate of descent was 1000 ft/min, increasing to 1700 ft/min. At 11:43 the Metro was over the FAF at an altitude of 2379 feet. The altitude at this stage should have been 2860 feet. The flight descended then through the segment minimum safe altitude of 2,060 ft. It continued to descend until it flew into the side of a heavily timbered ridge in the Iron Range National Park.

The positioning flight was conducted using instrument flight rules and had departed Scottsdale Airport, AZ (SDL) at 15:03 MST. The pilot occupying the left seat was not injured and the pilot occupying the right seat received minor injuries. 
In a statement to the NTSB provided by the Pilot-In-Command, upon arrival to TEX the weather was reported to be below minimums; the crew elected to hold over the Cones VOR and wait to see if weather conditions would improve. The crew was given instructions, by air traffic control, to hold as published and to expect further clearance (EFC) at 16:30. When the weather improved to a visibility of 4 miles and a ceiling of 2300 feet, the PIC requested a descent and approach to KTEX. At approximately 4 miles from the airport, the pilot acquired the airport environment but was not in position to land, so he called for a missed approach back to Cones VOR. The pilot then requested a second attempt to land stating that ""if we did not land, we would like to be sequenced to into KMTJ"" Montrose Regional Airport Montrose, CO, their alternate airport. On the second approach, both crew members stated that they had acquired the runway environment; however, they were still too high for a visual approach. The crew elected to do a 360-degree, right, descending turn, in order to get in a better position for landing. On completion of the turn, they again affirmed the runway environment and that they were aligned with the extended centerline of the runway. The airplane touched down and after full thrust reversers were deployed, the nose gear collapsed. The airplane began to slide in snow and came to a stop about mid-field, in an upright position.

An initial FAA examination of the area indicated that the airplane had touched down about 20-feet to the right, of the runway. Additionally, the airplane's wings were torn from the fuselage and the tail section had separated just aft of the engines, during the contact with the ground.

Weather reported at KTEX 10 minutes prior to the accident was winds 260 degrees at 8 knots, visibility of 3 miles, scattered clouds at 400 feet, broken clouds at 2300 feet, temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, dew point of 6 degrees Celsius, and altimeter setting 29.85 inches of mercury.";16:59;Learjet 45XR;Aero Jet Services;Saturday 3 January 2009

Three other light aircraft, a Dornier 228, an Antonov 28 and a Cessna 208, landed safely at the airfield on runway 27 after the HS-748 accident. Two Antonov 12 aircraft inbound to Lokichoggio from Torit, Southern Sudan, diverted to Juba upon getting information of the runway obstruction.
Transafrik Hercules S9-BAS, flying for the United Nations World Food Programme, contacted Lokichoggio Tower at 14:30 hours. The aircraft was returning from a food air drop at Motot, Southern Sudan. The pilot was advised to divert to Eldoret International Airport but he opted to land at Lokichoggio. The Tower cleared the Hercules to land on runway 27 at the pilot’s discretion. The aircraft made a very heavy landing short of the runway and the top centre fuselage broke. The aircraft came to a stop about one kilometre from the touchdown point. Shortly before coming to a halt, the aircraft impacted the HS 748 with its right wing tip. The captain, the first officer, the flight engineer and the two loadmasters evacuated themselves safely.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The commercial-rated pilot received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries, and the airplane was destroyed. The flight originated at Stuart-Witham Field, FL (SUA) the same day, about 18:45.

The pilot stated that he initiated a fuel transfer due to a fuel imbalance. To affect the fuel transfer, he said he ""began crossfeed right to left."" When the airplane was about 5 to 10 miles away from Spruce Creek Airport, the pilot said he began his descent from 12,500, and also executed a left turn to begin setting up to land, when suddenly, both engines ceased operating. When he levelled the wings both engines restarted due to auto-ignition. He said the fuel gages showed 300 to 350 lb of fuel for the right tank, and 100 to 150 pounds on the left, so he decided to continue his approach to Spruce Creek Airport. As he approached Spruce Creek Airport, he again entered a left bank to prepare for a left base to runway 23, and while established in the left turn, both engines ceased operating a second time. He said he did not think he could reach the runway, and decided to make an landing on a taxiway. When the wings became level after the turn, he said both engines again restarted while in the vicinity of the beginning of the taxiway. As he was about to land, he said a car pulled out onto the taxiway, and stopped on the centerline, so he applied power to avoid the car. He said he climbed straight out, and when he made a climbing left turn, he said the engines ceased operating a third time, and the airplane descended towards a cluster of condos. With no runway or clear area in sight, the pilot said he guided the airplane to a retention pond.";19:15;Beechcraft 300 Super King Air;Mass Bay Kustom Leasing;Wednesday 14 April 2004

The aircraft sustained substantial damage; however, neither of the 2 flight crewmembers nor any of their 12 passengers were injured. 
The flight originated from Pago Pago, American Samoa, at 06:09 as a regularly scheduled non-stop domestic passenger flight to Fitiuta. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a composite IFR/VFR flight plan was filed.
The captain overflew the Fitiuta airfield to assess winds conditions and the windsock indicated a quartering headwind for runway 12. During rollout the airplane veered immediately right when the power levers were brought into beta. The captain corrected with rudder and braking but was unable to maintain directional control. The aircraft ran off the right side of the runway and collided with a ditch and an embankment. After deplaning, the crew found that the winds were a 60-degree tailwind on runway 12. The windsock's pivot point on the pole was rusted and would not rotate. The aircraft with the same landing weight and a 60-degree 10-knot tailwind would require a 1,600-foot landing roll on the 2,350-foot runway without the assistance of both props in beta. The beta pin had backed out of position on the left engine's beta control linkage. The beta pin, cotter pin, and washer were found in the bottom of the engine cowling. The left engine had been changed 2 days prior to the accident. As the mechanics finished the beta pin area during engine installation, the inspector checked the area and found that the pin was in place and properly safety wired. Following the inspector's signoff of the area, the mechanics discovered that the teleflex cable was too short for the beta valve to be flushed and subsequently had to be adjusted. The director of maintenance readjusted the cable, which required disturbing the safety wire on the beta pin. One of the two mechanics that had been instructed to re-safety the connections after the adjustment thought that the rear portion had already been safetied and did not recheck the area. The inspector believed the area had already been checked and did not re-examine the beta pin.";06:45;de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 200;Samoa Aviation;Friday 23 April 1999

One of the three crew members was killed.
The airplane departed Saskatoon Airport, SK (YXE) at 15:03 for a geophysical survey flight to the east of Saskatoon. 
At about 18:14 the aircraft experienced a shudder from the right engine just before it smoothly spooled down. The propeller rotation slowed and the aircraft yawed. The right engine torque fell below 20%. The crew confirmed that the right engine had lost power. Altitude at the time was 2300 feet and the 2 survey sensors were deployed behind and below the aircraft.
The captain set maximum power on the left engine and the crew commenced to shut down the right hand engine. As the first officer had more experience on the aircraft than the captain, the pilots agreed to let the FO continue as pilot flying. The captain would continue with the checklists and radio communications.
At 18:17 the captain notified the Saskatoon control tower of the situation with a MAYDAY call, advising they had lost power on one engine and were returning to Saskatoon. 
By 18:18, the aircraft had climbed to 2600 feet asl and accelerated to about 99 KIAS, and the pilots had instructed the survey equipment operator to recover the survey sensors. The survey equipment operator got up to do so. The recovery process took 4 to 5 minutes. At 18:25, the flight reached 3100 feet asl (about 1400 agl), the maximum altitude following the right engine power loss.
By 18:27, airspeed was about 105 to 110 KIAS, and both pilots had visual contact with the runway. The FO's plan was to fly a high steep approach, and he had not yet reduced the left engine power lever setting for the approach. The tower cleared the flight to land on runway 27.
Meanwhile the fuel level left tank or fuel pressure left engine annunciators had illuminated, along with the master caution light. Neither pilot observed these annunciations.
At about 18:28, airspeed was 105 KIAS or greater when the left engine smoothly lost power with no surging. The captain observed the torque indicator smoothly and rapidly decreasing from 100% to 20% within a couple of seconds. The airplane decelerated and yawed to the left. The altitude was 3000 feet asl (about 1300 feet agl). 
Both pilots immediately concluded the flight would not reach the runway, and the captain pointed out a large street to the FO as a feasible forced landing site and the FO concurred. Neither pilot could see any better alternative. The left hand prop was then feathered.
The FO maintained control of the aircraft throughout the descent. Airspeed slowed initially to 100 KIAS and later to 90 KIAS. The goal was to control the descent and impact, with a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS to prevent a departure from controlled flight. 
The pilots observed traffic on the road. They revised the intended touchdown site to the grass beside 51st Street, to the right of the traffic and light poles and the left of what they perceived as a frangible fence.
Late in the descent the pilots identified that the fence was actually a noise abatement wall. The FO concluded that the flight could not be extended beyond the noise abatement wall and advised the other crew members. The aircraft landed astride the wall at 90 KIAS. When the aircraft came to a stop, the captain turned off the batteries and the master switch and pressed the cockpit engine fire extinguisher buttons.";18:30;CASA C-212-CC40 Aviocar 200;Fugro Aviation Canada;Friday 1 April 2011

The pilot proceeded to apply maximum reverse and maximum brakes and the airplane decelerated until a speed of approximately 20-30 kts. It traveled the last 600-800 meters of runway without increasing or reducing speed. Subsequently the pilot-in-command decided to steer the plane off the runway to avoid collision with the ILS system and stopped both engines. The aircraft collided with a mound of earth, causing structural damages.";16:38;Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II;CEDMA Aviación;Tuesday 22 March 2016

The aircraft lost its number 1 and 2 engine cowlings on takeoff from Seattle. Following the separation of the cowlings, the flight returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and landed without further incident. There were no injuries. Post-accident inspection of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the aircraft's left wing and left horizontal stabilizer. 

The aircraft maintenance log indicated that on the previous flight (from Anchorage to Seattle, arriving at 07:18), the flight crew had written up discrepancies that the number 2 engine would not go into reverse thrust, and that the captain's course deviation indicator (CDI) was frozen. The frozen captain's CDI was determined to be a non-deferrable, Aircraft-on-Ground (AOG) item. There was also a deferred maintenance item (DMI) on the number 1 thrust reverser. Due to concerns expressed by the captain of the incoming flight about the operability of the thrust reversers in consideration of icy runway conditions at Anchorage, maintenance also decided to lube, inspect, and check all four thrust reversers for proper operation.
One mechanic working on the number 2 thrust reverser asked the mechanic working on the number 1 thrust reverser to finish up the aircraft and close all engine cowls, since he had already worked over three hours overtime. 
The mechanic who worked on the number 1 thrust reverser, and who was asked by the first mechanic to close all engine cowls, reported that he lowered the number 1 and 2 cowling doors, but that he and another mechanic were unable to secure and lock the doors. He stated that about 16:00, they returned to the shop for assistance in locking and securing the cowling doors. He stated that at that time, he entered in the turnover log that all four cowling doors required securing, and also verbally reported this to two other mechanics from the next shift. 
One of the company mechanics who took the turnover report on the cowl doors from the first-shift mechanic stated that at about 1530, he received a tie-in from that mechanic (the one assigned to the number 1 thrust reverser) that all cowlings on N811CK needed to be closed.
He noted that the cowlings for the number 1 and number 2 engines were closed and that those for the number 3 and 4 engines were wide open. He assisted in closing the number 3 engine cowl, but did not check the number 1 or number 2 cowlings to ensure that they were secured. 
The captain reported that his first indication of any problems was at rotation, when the number 2 engine N2 (high pressure section) RPM indication went to zero and the number 2 engine generator light came on. He stated he also noticed the aircraft roll left slightly at that time. The captain reported that he and his crew were diagnosing the problem when the control tower called and notified him that his aircraft had left debris on the runway during takeoff. The captain stated that he then called company headquarters in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and decided to return to Seattle-Tacoma International. 

The flight engineer reported that the cowlings were closed when he arrived at the aircraft, that he observed no abnormalities during the exterior preflight inspection.

The number 1 and 2 engine cowls completely departed the aircraft during the accident sequence. Several cowl sections were found on the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport runway; two cowling sections were also found in a residential area in the Browns Point area of Tacoma, Washington, approximately 10 nautical miles south-southwest of the airport.";21:37;McDonnell Douglas DC-8-63F;Kitty Hawk International;Saturday 19 February 2000

The pedestrian sustained serious injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The captain, first officer, and the three passengers on board the airplane were not injured.
The purpose of the flight was to provide logistical support of ICEX 2018, which involves, in part, U.S. Navy and U.K Royal Navy submarines operating beneath the frozen Arctic Ocean during a 5-week exercise. The flight used an airstrip on the sea ice that was lined on both sides with snow berms. The airstrip included one runway oriented north/south and an intersecting runway oriented east/west. Weather conditions at the time of the accident consisted of clear skies with ice pack haze. The sun was low on the horizon, resulting in shadows on the airstrip, and flat light conditions made it difficult to discern topographical features.

The captain said that, after back-taxiing the airplane to the south end of the airstrip and just before beginning the takeoff roll to the north, both pilots saw the pedestrian standing near the departure end of the airstrip on the left side and near the intersection of the east/west runway. He said that during the takeoff roll, the airplane veered slightly to the left of centerline, so he applied differential engine power to correct the veer, and the airplane returned to the centerline. As the takeoff roll continued, the airplane subsequently became airborne, so he lowered the nose to remain within ground effect and gain airspeed before initiating a climb. He said that as the airspeed increased, he started to climb the airplane, then initiated a left turn. During the turn, both pilots said they heard a loud thump, which was immediately followed by an aileron control anomaly. The captain reported that he continued the left turn and subsequently entered a left downwind traffic pattern for an emergency landing to the north. The captain said that after landing, both pilots saw the pedestrian lying near a snow berm on the left side of the airstrip.

A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the left wing and left aileron. The pedestrian sustained a serious head and neck injuries because of the collision, and he was subsequently medevacked to Anchorage, Alaska for treatment.";19:45;de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300;Bald Mountain Air Services;Tuesday 20 March 2018

All 31 passengers and three crew members survived. The airplane operated on a flight from Reykjavík Domestic Airport (RKV), Iceland to Godthåb/Nuuk Airport (GOH), Greenland with an enroute stop at Kulusuk.
At 12:58, the flight crew of TF-JMB made radio contact with Nuuk AFIS and were informed that the runway in use was 23.
The weather was reported to be: wind direction from 170° at a speed of 24 kts with a maximum of 43 kts, the visibility was 4,000 meters in light snow, moderate blowing snow, a few clouds at 1,800 feet, broken clouds at 3,500 feet, the temperature was zero, the dew point was minus four Celsius and the QNH was 1014 hPa. 
The flight crew made visual contact with the runway and decided to deviate to the right (west) of the offset Localizer (LLZ) to runway 23. The flight continued towards the runway from a position right of the runway centerline. The flight crew was aiming to land the aircraft at a point between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone. 
As the aircraft approached runway 23 it was still in the final right turn over the landing threshold.
The aircraft touched down on runway 23 between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone and to the left of the runway centerline. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data indicated that the aircraft was banking more than 11° to the right as the aircraft touched down. At the same time the vertical acceleration was approximately 3.9 G and the rate of descent was greater than 13 feet per second.
The right main landing gear (MLG) shock strut fuse pin sheared and the right MLG collapsed, the aircraft skidded down the runway and departed the runway to the right.

At this point the crew heard a loud 'bang' and the left engine Fire Warning activated. The FO continued to control the aircraft, keeping it straight against the potential yaw and maintaining a climb profile. The commander shut down the engine, feathered the propeller and activated the fire extinguishers for the engine. He instructed the first officer to climb to 1,500 feet and make a left turn to conduct a visual left hand circuit to land back at Jersey. A mayday call was made to Jersey Tower informing them of the problem and the commander's intentions. On the downwind leg, the commander took over the handling of the aircraft and conducted a single engine approach and landing on runway 27, which was carried out uneventfully.;10:49;Fokker F-27 Friendship 500;Channel Express;Tuesday 5 June 2001

Flight 4064 departed at 22:30, some 15 minutes behind the planned schedule. The handling pilot for the sector was the first officer; this was decided during the pre-flight briefing, given the good meteorological conditions expected at destination. As soon as the Ibiza METAR had been obtained, while still in the cruise phase, the first officer planned for an ILS approach to runway 24, set up the navigation aids and programmed the Flight Management Guidance Computers (FMGC's) accordingly. He pre-selected the BSCU (Brake and Steering Control Unit) Autobrake system to Low. Upon this selection, a 'BRAKES BSCU CH 2 FAULT' was annunciated to the crew. There was no ECAM procedure to be followed. The selection was repeated but the fault remained. The Status Page displayed 'Inop Sys BSCU2 Fault' ('Inoperative System, BSCU Channel 2 Fault'). The crew checked the relevant section of the Flight Crew Operating Manual Volume 3 and this stated that the indication was for' Crew Awareness'. No further crew action was specified. At 00:46 hrs the crew were authorised to land on runway 24, wind of 020deg at 5 knots. The aircraft made the flare and a gentle touchdown about 800 metres from the start of runway 24. A slight tailwind component was apparent, of approx. 4 kt. Reverse thrust was selected and initial deceleration appeared normal. The commander considered that more braking was required in order to slow the aircraft to achieve the planned turn off the runway, so he advised the first officer to apply more braking.
The first officer tried to apply more braking but found this ineffective. He informed the commander of this and, around 80 kt, the first officer reduced reverse thrust. The commander immediately took control, reapplied reverse thrust and attempted to apply the brakes. He too found that there was no braking available. Therefore, the commander began to swerve the aircraft each way in an attempt to increase the available braking distance and slow the aircraft down by lateral skidding before reaching the end of the runway, with the tyres leaving rubber marks on the runway surface. The aircraft left the end of the runway, entering the paved stopway and then into and beyond the 60 m overrun area. The captain elected to turn the aircraft to the right to remain within the aerodrome boundary. The nose landing gear collapsed as the aircraft ran on softer and more rugged terrain to approach an earth embankment and then came to rest with both engines partially embedded in it.";ca 00:50;Airbus A320-212;Air UK Leisure;Thursday 21 May 1998

The flight crew received weather information and IFR route clearance from the controller at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, Florida, USA. Departure time was 13:06 hours local time. From the cockpit voice recorder it was evident that the flight crew failed to brief or discuss the weather for departure or enroute. Additionally, they failed to complete several important checklists as required and did not observe sterile cockpit procedures during startup, run-up, taxi and takeoff. 
The enroute and approach checklists were not conducted prior to arriving near their destination of Marsh Harbour Airport, Bahamas. The crew was aware of the weather conditions at Marsh Harbor, which included heavy rainshowers; however, they never formulated a plan for diversion if the weather was bad at their time of arrival.
As the approach continued there were constant disagreements between both pilots as to who had the runway in sight. Due to the weather conditions, visibility of the runway was intermittent, yet the crew continued descending visually in an attempt to land the aircraft on a runway that was not in sight and not served by an instrument landing system (ILS).
The crew flew a non-stabilized approach and speed was not constant as they kept increasing and decreasing speed throughout the final approach. The captain, who initially was the non-flying pilot, while on final approach and below 500 feet AGL, assumed control of the aircraft from the flying pilot (first officer). At some point the captain lost use of his windshield wiper as it went over-center and was stuck. During the final moments of the approach. The copilot again assumed control of the aircraft and seconds before touch down, the captain (despite having no visual contact with the runway due to the intense downpour of rain and the non-use of his windshield wiper), again took control of the aircraft from the first officer.
By the time the aircraft touched the runway, there were several control wheel exchanges between both pilots while neither had a visual of the runway.
The aircraft initially touched down at 17:49:02 with a recorded vertical load factor of +2.16G, approximately 14 seconds after crossing the threshold of runway 09. Upon initial landing however, the aircraft bounced and became airborne, reaching a calculated maximum height of approximately 15 feet AGL.
The aircraft bounced a second time at 17:49:07 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.19G. During this second bounce, the pitch attitude was 1.8 degrees nose down, heading 102 degrees magnetic and airspeed 106 KIAS.
The aircraft made consecutive contact with the runway approximately three times. The third and final bounce occurred at 17:49:14 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.66G. During the third bounce, the pitch attitude was 2.2 degrees nose down, heading 099 degrees magnetic and airspeed 98 KIAS.
As a result of the hard touchdown, damage was sustained to the right wing and right hand engine/propeller. The right hand engine parameters recorded a rapid loss of power with decreasing engine speed and torque, and subsequent propeller stoppage. The aircraft veered off to the right at approximate time of 17:49:20 on a heading of 131 degrees magnetic at a point approximately 6,044 feet from the threshold of runway 09.
The recorded airspeed was 44 KIAS with the left hand engine torque at 26 % and the right hand engine torque at 0%. The aircraft came to a full stop at approximate time 17:49:25 on a heading of 231 degrees magnetic. When the aircraft came to a stop, the flight and cabin crew and 21 passengers evacuated the aircraft. The evacuation was uneventful using the main entrance door.";13:50;Saab 340B;SkyBahamas Airlines;Thursday 13 June 2013

The takeoff was initiated on a slight downhill slope, into approximately 70 degrees of crosswind, with a minimum of 2000 feet available to a predetermined reject point. All engine parameters were normal; however, the aircraft did not accelerate as expected and the takeoff continued approximately 800 feet past the reject point, to an area where the terrain sloped more steeply into a depression. The aircraft became airborne at low speed over the depression and maximum power was applied in order to clear gently rising terrain ahead. The main gear contacted the ground on the far side of the depression, and the aircraft bounced and touched down a second time in an area covered by basketball size rocks.

Neither of the 2 flight crew were injured. The flight originated from the Louisville International Airport (SDF), Kentucky.
The airplane sustained damage to a 23 foot long section of lower fuselage skin, 4 fuselage stringers, 5 fuselage frames, 3 floor stringers and the tail skid. The replacement of the frames and stringers was considered a major repair.
According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer the pilot monitoring for the flight from SDF-ABQ. Ground operations were normal in SDF and no aircraft loading or Weight and Balance discrepancies were noted. The climb, cruise, and descent portion of the flight were uneventful. Weather conditions at ABQ prior to arrival were reported as visual conditions, with wind from 090 at 20 knots gusting to 29 knots. The target approach speed used was 146 knots. The crew was vectored to the ILS approach to runway 03 and joined the localizer and glideslope using the autopilot. The autopilot was then disengaged at 1103 feet Height Above Touchdown (HAT) and at 1000 feet HAT the approach met all UPS Stabilized Approach criteria with the aircraft fully configured at flaps 30, gear down, and speed 145 knots. At 500 feet HAT the approach continued to meet all stabilized approach criteria with speed 146 knots. Flight data indicated that the crosswind component at this point was 23 knots from the right.
At 158 feet above touchdown the approach met all stabilized approach criteria and the captain disconnected the autothrottles. UPS guidance recommends use of the autothrottle until 50 feet above touchdown. From this point on the approach until touchdown, the aircraft pitch attitude began to increase as the airspeed slowly decreased. Flight Data indicates that the thrust levers were at a reduced thrust setting when the autothrottles were disconnected and remained at that setting until touchdown. At 1.75 seconds from touchdown the airspeed had decayed to 129 knots and the aircraft pitch had increased to 7.2 degrees. The crosswind had also decreased and was now 13 knots from the right. At touchdown the airspeed was 128 knots and pitch attitude 8.4 degrees. The tailskid impacted the runway at touchdown followed immediately by the lower aft fuselage as the pitch attitude increased momentarily to 8.6 degrees. Initial tailskid impact occurred at approximately 800 feet from the runway threshold.
The crew reported that they encountered a 10 knot wind loss just prior to touchdown and landed firmer than normal, but didn't suspect that they had struck the tailskid.";06:31;Boeing 767-34AFER (WL);United Parcel Service - UPS;Saturday 5 March 2016

The aircraft was then prepared for flight CRX498 to Dresden.
Taxi clearance was given at 17:50 and the crew taxied to runway 28. At 17:54 the aircraft was cleared for takeoff. Takeoff and climb were conducted with flaps at 0 degrees, which is normal for a Saab 340 departing from runway 28. The aircraft climbed normally at 136 knots IAS. After retracting the gear the Flight Director was switched on, NAV mode engaged and LRN1 captured. The initial track was normal, except for a track drift to the south of about 7deg. While climbing through 2500 feet QNH the crew switched to Zurich Departure Control and were recleared to climb to FL110. At 17:55 the crew were cleared to make a left turn to intercept airway R234 to the ZUE beacon (the Zurich East -ZUE One Yankee departure). A left turn was initiated, during which the first officer entered a command in the Flight Management System (FMS). After having turned left for 7 seconds the captain started a right turn, which would be consistent with Flight Director commands generated by the FMS for a 'direct to ZUE'. The right turn was continued with an increasing bank angle, which continued to 42deg with a constant rate of climb, whilst the pitch concurrently reduced to 0deg. Right aileron input then caused a increase in right roll rate. The first officer advised the captain that the aircraft should actually turn to the left. This was also noted by the Zurich departure controller at 17:56:20, who asked the crew about the direction of the turn. The first officer replied: ""Moment please, stand by"". Upon which the Departure controller recleared the flight to continue the right turn direct to ZUE. By then the pitch had also decreased rapidly, accompanied by a marked speed increase and the Saab entered a high speed high-rate spiral descent. At 17:56:28 the aircraft crashed in an open field.
Weather reported included temperature 2deg C; dew point 1deg C; 1032 mB wind WNW/3 knots and light drizzle. The captain was an employee of Moldavian Airlines, temporarily transferred to Crossair.

On touch down, the right hand main landing gear collapsed resulting from a collision with an obstacle of approximately 2 meter high on short final approach. The aircraft subsequently had a runway excursion to the starboard side. A segment of the right hand wing contacted the ground and was severed off from the rest of the wing with ensuing fuel spillage and fire. All the four propeller blades of the starboard engine contacted the ground surface and suffered rearwards bends. The fire was however contained before spreading further.

The airplane climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL380, which was reached at about 06:06 MST. The descend for Carlsbad was started an hour later, at 06:06 PST. Air traffic control cleared the flightcrew for the ILS approach to runway 24, which was 4,897 feet long. The flightcrew then reported that they had the runway in sight, cancelled their IFR clearance, and executed a VFR approach in VFR conditions to the airport. The reported winds favoured a landing toward the east, onto the opposite runway (runway 6). During the approach, after a query from the first officer, the captain indicated to the first officer that he was going to ""...land to the east,"" consistent with the reported winds. However, the final approach and subsequent landing were made to runway 24, which produced a six-knot tailwind. During the approach sequence the captain maintained an airspeed that was approximately 30 knots higher than the correct airspeed for the aircraft's weight, resulting in the aircraft touching down about 1,500 feet further down the runway than normal, and much faster than normal. The captain then delayed the initiation of a go-around until the first officer asked if they were going around. Although the aircraft lifted off the runway surface prior to departing the paved overrun during the delayed go-around it impacted a localizer antenna platform, whose highest non-frangible structure was located approximately 304 feet past the end of the runway, and approximately two feet lower than the terrain at the departure end of the runway. The aircraft continued airborne as it flew over downsloping terrain for about 400 more feet before colliding with the terrain and a commercial storage building that was located at an elevation approximately 80 feet lower than the terrain at the end of the runway. The localizer antenna platform was located outside of the designated runway safety area, and met all applicable FAA siting requirements.";06:40;Cessna 560 Citation V;Goship Air;Tuesday 24 January 2006

The WestJet aircraft was positioned directly behind and perpendicular to a Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800 (C-FPRP), which was parked at Gate B13. 
The Sunwing aircraft was being prepared to be towed to another location at the airport. A Sunwing maintenance technician was in the cockpit of C-FPRP, and the aircraft's APU was running. Two ground personnel were in the cab of the tow vehicle. The tow vehicle was informed by the North Apron controller to pushback at their discretion.
The Sunwing aircraft (under tow) began to move back and the APU contacted the right wing of the stationary WestJet aircraft. A fire rapidly ensued. The WestJet flight crew immediately commenced the required steps for an evacuation, and an evacuation was ordered shortly after. The tow vehicle operator pulled the Sunwing aircraft back towards the gate to separate the two aircraft.

The wreckage came to rest on the west bank of the Des Plaines River, in a forest preserve south of the airport. Both pilots were killed in the accident.
The flight departed Pontiac-Oakland County International Airport, MI (PTK) at 13:35 and was scheduled to pickup cargo at Chicago-Executive Airport, IL (PWK).
During the descent and 14 minutes before the accident, the airplane encountered a layer of moderate rime ice. The captain, who was the pilot flying, and the first officer, who was the monitoring pilot, made multiple statements which were consistent with their awareness and presence of airframe icing. After obtaining visual flight rules conditions, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight rules clearance and continued with a right, circling approach to runway 34. While turning into the base leg of the traffic pattern, and 45 seconds prior to the accident, the captain called for full flaps and the engine power levers were adjusted several times between 50 and 95 percent. In addition, the captain inquired about the autopilot and fuel balance. In response, the first officer stated that he did not think that the spoilerons were working. Shortly thereafter, the first officer gave the command to add full engine power and the airplane impacted terrain.
There was no evidence of flight crew impairment or fatigue in the final 30 minutes of the flight. The cockpit voice recorder showed multiple instances during the flight in which the airplane was below 10,000 feet mean sea level that the crew was engaged in discussions that were not consistent with a sterile cockpit environment, for example a lengthy discussion about Class B airspeeds, which may have led to a relaxed and casual cockpit atmosphere. In addition, the flight crew appears to have conducted checklists in a generally informal manner. As the flight was conducted by a Part 135 operator, it would be expected that both pilots were versed with the importance of sterile cockpit rules and the importance of adhering to procedures, including demonstrating checklist discipline.

For approximately the last 24 seconds of flight, both pilots were likely focusing their attention on activities to identify and understand the reason for the airplane's roll handling difficulties, as noted by the captain's comment related to the fuel balance. These events, culminating in the first officer's urgent command to add full power, suggested that neither pilot detected the airplane's decaying energy state before it reached a critical level for the conditions it encountered.";ca 13:30;Learjet 35A;Royal Air Freight;Tuesday 5 January 2010

When the landing-gear handle was placed in the down position, the right main landing gear did not extend. The pilot and the right seat passenger/pilot attempted several times to lower the right main gear but failed. The pilot decided to land with all gear in the up position; however, the left main gear and the nose wheel did not retract when the gear handle was placed in the up position.

The co-pilot performed the external checks; this included checking the fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir. The aircraft was refuelled to 3,000 lb and, after the passengers boarded, it departed for Blackpool. The commander was the pilot flying (PF).
The takeoff and cruise to Blackpool were uneventful. 
The commander planned and briefed for the NDB approach to runway 10, which was to be flown with the autopilot engaged. Whilst descending through FL120, the left, followed by the right, hydraulic low pressure cautions illuminated. Upon checking the hydraulic pressure gauge, the pressure was noted to be ‘cycling up and down’, but for the majority of the time it indicated about 2,800 psi (in the green arc). During this time the hydraulic low pressure cautions went on and off irregularly, with the left caution being on more often than the right. The co-pilot then actioned the ‘HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILURE’ checklist. It stated that if the hydraulic pressure was a minimum of 2,800 psi, the flight could be continued.
Just before the aircraft reached the Blackpool NDB, the commander commented ""it’s dropping"", but he could not recall what he was referring to. This was followed by the roll fail and speed brk [brake] fail caution messages illuminating. The co-pilot then actioned the applicable checklists. These stated that the Landing Distances Required (LDR) would increase by approximately 65% and 21%, respectively. As the roll fail LDR increase was greater than that of the speed brk fail, the crew used an LDR increase of 65% which the co-pilot equated to 5,950 ft. Runway 10 at Blackpool has an LDA of 6,131 ft, therefore they elected to continue to Blackpool.
The roll fail checklist stated that a ‘FLAPS UP’ landing was required. The co-pilot then calculated the VREF of 132 kt, including a 20 kt increment, as stipulated by the ‘FLAPS UP, 10, OR 20 APPROACH AND LANDING’ checklist. The commander then continued with the approach.
At about 4 nm on final approach the co-pilot lowered the landing gear, in response to the commander’s request. About 8 seconds later the commander said ""just lost it all""; referring to the general state of the aircraft. This was followed almost immediately by the landing gear unsafe aural warning, as the main landing gear was not indicating down and locked. Whilst descending through 1,000 ft, at just over 3 nm from the threshold, the commander asked the co-pilot to action the ‘ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION’ checklist.
The commander then discontinued the approach by selecting ALT HOLD, increased engine thrust and selected a 500 ft/min rate of climb on the autopilot. However, a few seconds later, before the co-pilot could action the checklist, the main gear indicated down and locked. The commander disconnected the autopilot and continued the approach. The crew did not consider reviewing the ‘HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILURE’ checklist as they had not recognised the symptoms of loss of hydraulic pressure.
When ATC issued the aircraft its landing clearance the wind was from 140° at 17 kt. This equated to a headwind component of about 10 kt and a crosswind of about 12 kt. As the aircraft descended through 500 ft (the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for the approach) at 1.5 nm from the threshold, the commander instructed the co-pilot to advise ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and to request the RFFS to be put on standby. There was a slight delay in transmitting this request, due to another aircraft on frequency, but the request was acknowledged by ATC.
The aircraft touched down about 1,500 ft from the start of the paved surface at an airspeed of 132 kt and a groundspeed of 124 kt. When the commander applied the toe (power) brakes he felt no significant retardation. During the landing roll no attempt was made to apply the emergency brakes, as required in the event of a power brake failure. The co-pilot asked if he should try to operate the lift dump, but it failed to function, due to the lack of hydraulic pressure. At some point, while the aircraft was on the runway, the co-pilot transmitted a MAYDAY call to ATC. When an overrun appeared likely, the commander shut down the engines. The aircraft subsequently overran the end of the runway at a groundspeed of about 80 kt. The commander later commented that he was in a ""state of panic"" during the landing roll and was unsure whether or not he had applied the emergency brake.
As the aircraft left the paved surface the commander steered the aircraft slightly right to avoid a shallow downslope to the left of runway’s extended centreline. The aircraft continued across the rough, uneven ground, during which the nose gear collapsed and the wing to fuselage attachments were severely damaged. Once it had come to a stop, he shut down the remaining aircraft systems. The passengers and crew, who were uninjured, vacated the aircraft via the entry/exit door and moved upwind to a safe distance.";11:48;Raytheon 390 Premier I;Pool Aviation;Thursday 12 March 2015

Two of the four persons on board were killed.
Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the business flight that departed Tulsa-Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport, OK (RVS), at 13:58 CDT.
According to preliminary air traffic control information, at 16:10, the accident pilot established radio communications with South Bend Approach Control while at 11,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The air traffic controller cleared the flight direct to KNUTE intersection and told the pilot to expect a visual approach to runway 9R. At 16:11, the flight was cleared to descend to 10,000 feet msl. At 16:13, the flight was cleared to 3,000 feet msl. At 16:15, the approach controller told the pilot to make a 5-degree left turn to align with runway 9R and asked the pilot to report when he had the airport in sight. At 16:15:07, the pilot declared an emergency because of a lack of engine power, reporting that they were ""dead stick"" and without any power. About 23 seconds later, at 16:15:30, the pilot transmitted ""we've lost all power, and we have no hydraulics."" When the controller asked if the airplane remained controllable, the pilot replied ""ah, barely controllable."" The controller advised that all runways at South Bend were available for landing and issued the current winds, which were 130-degrees at 10 knots. At 16:15:22, the pilot transmitted that the airplane’s navigational systems were inoperative and requested a radar vector toward the airport. The controller replied that the airport was 9 miles directly ahead of the airplane's current position. At 16:16:12, the controller told the pilot to turn 10-degrees left to intersect runway 9R. At 16:16:15, the pilot replied ""26DK, turning left."" No additional voice communications were received from the accident airplane. The approach controller continued to transmit radar vectors toward runway 9R without any response from the accident pilot. At 16:18:58, the approach controller told the accident airplane to go-around because the main landing gear was not extended. (The tower controller had informed the approach controller that only the nose landing gear was extended) The accident airplane was then observed to climb and enter a right traffic pattern for runway 9R. The airplane made another landing approach to runway 9R with only the nose landing gear extended. Several witnesses observed the airplane bounce several times on the runway before it ultimately entered a climbing right turn. The airplane was then observed to enter a nose low descent into a nearby residential community.
The airplane came down in a street, crashing into a house near the 1600 block of N. Iowa Street, South Bend. The accident location is approx 1000 metres south of the end of runway 09R.

Factual information released by the NTSB suggest that the pilot-rated passenger was allowed to fly the descent under supervision of the captain. The pilot-rated passenger had accumulated 1,576 hours in multi-engine airplanes and 301 hours in single-engine airplanes. He had no experience in turbine-powered business jets. During the descent the captain instructed the passenger to ""just pull the power out"" in order to slow the airplane down. Apparently the passenger lifted the pull-up locks on the throttles and retarded the throttles beyond flight idle, into the fuel cut-off position. The pilot told the pilot-rated-passenger ""you went back behind the stops and we lost power.""

The two pilots and the two flight test engineers were fatally injured.
The accident occurred during a planned one-engine-inoperative (OEI) takeoff when a stall on the right outboard wing produced a rolling moment that the flight crew was not able to control, which led to the right wingtip contacting the runway and the airplane departing the runway from the right side. After departing the runway, the airplane impacted a concrete structure and an airport weather station, resulting in extensive structural damage and a postcrash fire that completely consumed the fuselage and cabin interior.

The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation of this accident found that the airplane stalled while lifting off the ground. As a result, the NTSB examined the role of ""ground effect"" on the airplane's performance. Ground effect refers to changes in the airflow over the airplane resulting from the proximity of the airplane to the ground. Ground effect results in increased lift and reduced drag at a given angle of attack (AOA) as well as a reduction in the stall AOA. In preparing for the G650 field performance flight tests, Gulfstream considered ground effect when predicting the airplane's takeoff performance capability but overestimated the in ground effect stall AOA. Consequently, the airplane's AOA threshold for stick shaker (stall warning) activation and the corresponding pitch limit indicator (on the primary flight display) were set too high, and the flight crew received no tactile or visual warning before the actual stall occurred.

The accident flight was the third time that a right outboard wing stall occurred during G650 flight testing. Gulfstream did not determine (until after the accident) that the cause of two previous uncommanded roll events was a stall of the right outboard wing at a lower-than-expected AOA. (Similar to the accident circumstances, the two previous events occurred during liftoff; however, the right wingtip did not contact the runway during either of these events.) If Gulfstream had performed an in-depth aerodynamic analysis of these events shortly after they occurred, the company could have recognized before the accident that the actual in-ground-effect stall AOA was lower than predicted.

During field performance testing before the accident, the G650 consistently exceeded target takeoff safety speeds (V2). V2 is the speed that an airplane attains at or before a height above the ground of 35 feet with one engine inoperative. Gulfstream needed to resolve these V2 exceedances because achieving the planned V2 speeds was necessary to maintain the airplane's 6,000-foot takeoff performance guarantee (at standard sea level conditions). If the G650 did not meet this takeoff performance guarantee, then the airplane could only operate on longer runways. However, a key assumption that Gulfstream used to develop takeoff speeds was flawed and resulted in V2 speeds that were too low and takeoff distances that were longer than anticipated.

Rather than determining the root cause for the V2 exceedance problem, Gulfstream attempted to reduce the V2 speeds and the takeoff distances by modifying the piloting technique used to rotate the airplane for takeoff. Further, Gulfstream did not validate the speeds using a simulation or physics-based dynamic analysis before or during field performance testing. If the company had done so, then it could have recognized that the target V2 speeds could not be achieved even with the modified piloting technique. In addition, the difficulties in achieving the target V2 speeds were exacerbated in late March 2011 when the company reduced the target pitch angle for some takeoff tests without an accompanying increase in the takeoff speeds.

Gulfstream maintained an aggressive schedule for the G650 flight test program so that the company could obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification by the third quarter of 2011. The schedule pressure, combined with inadequately developed organizational processes for technical oversight and safety management, led to a strong focus on keeping the program moving and a reluctance to challenge key assumptions and highlight anomalous airplane behavior during tests that could slow the pace of the program. These factors likely contributed to key errors, including the development of unachievable takeoff speeds, as well as the superficial review of the two previous uncommanded roll events, which allowed the company's overestimation of the in-ground-effect stall AOA to remain undetected.";09:34;Gulfstream G650;Gulfstream Aerospace;Saturday 2 April 2011

The flight departed Ekaterinburg at 19:47 local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of 10,100 m. Some three hours after takeoff, at 01:50 local time, descent was initiated. The descent and approach into Irkutsk was flown by the first officer. 
At 02:05 the crew reported at 2100 m, runway in sight. The airplane still had an airspeed of 540 km/h. The maximum speed at which the landing gear may be lowered was 400 km/h. At 02:06:56 the airplane level off at 900 m, the airspeed still being about 420 km/h. The first officer ordered the gear down and the speed further decreased to 395 km/h with engines at idle. When the gear was down and locked the airplane entered a left hand turn with a 20-23 degree bank. The airspeed further decreased to 365 km/h where the recommended speed was 370 km/h in this stage of the flight. Power was added slowly. This was only just sufficient for maintaining an altitude of 850 m at 355-360 km/h. At 02:07:46, while still in the left hand turn, the angle of attack increased to 16,5° because the autopilot attempted to maintain altitude with a decreasing speed. An aural warning then sounded, indicating a high angle of attack. The first officer attempted to correct this and by using the control column, he disconnected the autopilot. Because he deflected the control column to the left, the left bank increased trough the maximum permissible value of -30° to -44°, and then to -48°. With the nose pitched down the speed increased to 400 m. 
The airplane entered a layer of clouds, so the crew did not have a possibility of observing of the natural horizon and the landmarks under these conditions at night. 
The captain intervened and attempted to control the airplane. He alternately deflecting the steering wheel to the left and right. An intensive deflection of steering control to the right, caused a positive angular acceleration of +4,4°/sec2. The captain reacted by deflecting the steering wheel to the left again. The first officer now realizes that the airplane is in a severe left bank (-45°) and indicates that they should be rolling to the right. 
Because of an increase in vertical descent rate (20 m/sec), one of the crew members pulled the control column. The airplane pitched up rapidly, entered a stall and a subsequent flat spin. The crew were unable to regain control. After spinning for 22 seconds, the aircraft slammed down on its belly, broke up and burned.";02:08;Tupolev 154M;Vladivostokavia;Wednesday 4 July 2001

According to Al Jazeera the airline bought the plane 3 months ago from Bulgaria. Soviet Transports Fleet data indicate that YA-PIS was recently acquired by Pamir after a period of storage in Bulgaria.

An inquest was held at Bradford Crown Court, U.K. because three British men were on the plane. During the inquest it was reported that an early ground proximity warning system was misunderstood by the crew, either due to language problems or because of previous false alerts.

When the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded, the captain called for a go-around while pulling on the sidestick, reportedly without pressing his priority control button. The combination of dynamic winds and the crew actions created a situation that triggered the airplane's alpha protection system. As the crew applied TOGA power for a go-around, with both pilots pulling back on their sidesticks, the alpha protection law reduced the elevator nose-up command. Instead of a go- around, the aircraft struck the runway with a vertical speed of approx. 1,200 fpm.

The airplane was operated as an instructional flight that was not operating on a flight plan.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that last departed from Jonesboro Municipal Airport, Arkansas at 16:50 and was destined to DXE.
The pilot stated that the purpose of the flight was a Beechcraft B100 initial training flight with a second pilot who occupied the right pilot seat. According to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the flight instructor was in a non-seated position between both pilots.
The left seat pilot stated that they flew about 3 hours and had taken turns performing turns, stalls, slow flight and approaches. He stated that the accident landing was the third landing of the day that he performed. He said that during the left downwind approach for landing on runway 18, he performed the airplane checklist items that the flight instructor read to him. The left seat pilot said that the landing gear extended, and the three landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green. The left seat pilot said that during touchdown, the right side of the airplane descended lower than the left side and then the right main landing gear collapsed. The airplane veered off and into a grass area adjacent to the runway.
The aircraft came to rest approximately 2,518 feet from runway 18 touchdown end and 100 feet west of the runway edge in a field of grass. The right hand main gear was collapsed, right hand prop blades were bent and the right wing leading edge and tip was damaged. Evidence of fuel leakage was noted surrounding the right wing in the grass. The wing top skin outboard of the engine nacelle displayed evidence of wrinkling.
Post-accident examination revealed the bottom right wing skin to the integral fuel tank was torn resulting in an approximate five by three inch hole. The right main gear actuator assembly exhibited numerous bent parts and was broken out of its mounting structure. The inboard top actuator mounting structure was torn away from the airframe. The right nacelle fuel tank bulkhead was ruptured with the top of the gear actuator resting inside the tank area. The top wing skin wrinkling was not as evident post recovery but still shows signs of damage. Puncture damage to the fuselage pressure vessel was noted in 5 places below the copilot side window and a two-inch crack or tear was found on the belly skin approximately centered between the main gear legs.

Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA).
Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 11:19 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying.
At 12:00 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 12:40 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area.
This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain.
At 12:57 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground.
A missed approach was initiated at 13:10 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend.

The question was repeated and it took some time for the crew of PH-FZE to answer: ""We can accept runway one five"" at 11:56. They were then cleared to runway 15 with wind 250° and 11 kt. Four minutes later the aircraft was cleared to land with wind 240° at 12 kt varying between 210° and 300°. Due to the runway change, the pilot in command had decided to land with flaps 35° and a reference speed of 95 KIAS. The aircraft made some S-turns to lose altitude because it was a little high in the approach path. The airplane overflew the displaced threshold of runway 15 at approximately 15 ft. During the landing, the pilot in command realised that he could not engage the propeller ground idle/reverse, he said ""I have no reverse"" and applied brakes in an attempt to stop the aircraft. Later on, the co-pilot also applied brakes. During the landing roll the aircraft did not decelerate as expected. The wheel number 3 became locked and was deflated by a flat spot. The aircraft started to veer to the left of the runway until wheel number 1 left the runway at around 150 m before the end of the 1347 m long runway. The Fokker continued down an embankment of around 15 m in height and came to rest against the airport perimeter fence. The fuselage broke near seat rows 6 to 8, and the floor was heavily deformed between those rows. After the aircraft came to a stop, the captain had been injured, and the crew members were frozen for a while, until the flight observer pilot who was in the jump seat stated that the occupants should leave the aircraft immediately and started carrying out the on-ground emergency checklist. He pulled both fire handles and tried to close both fuel levers, but he was unable to close those levers. Then the captain turned on the evacuation lights. In the mean time, after a while and in absence of commands from the cockpit, the rear flight attendant instructed the passengers, who were all seated in the rear part of the cabin, to leave the aircraft through door 2R, which opened without problem.";12:01;Fokker 50;null;Friday 17 January 2003

All four crew members and 35 persons on the ground were killed.
Flight TK6491 departed Hong Kong on a cargo service to Istanbul, carrying a load of 85618 kgs. An en route refueling and crew change stop was planned at Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.
Weather at Bishkek was poor with winds from 60°at 1 m/s and a visibility (RVR) of 400m at the beginning of the runway; 350m at the mid-point and 400m at the end of the runway. Vertical visibility was 50 m. Air temperature was -9°C, dew point -10°C, pressure (QNH) was 1023,9 hPa.
The initial descent towards Bishkek was normal. The crew contacted Approach Control at 07:06 hours and were cleared for a descent to FL060 as per TOKPA 1 STAR (Standard terminal arrival route). The aircraft overflew the TOPKA reporting point at 07:11 at FL092 while in descent. According to the approach chart, FL060 or above should be reached when overflying TOKPA.
Shortly afterwards the controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 26. At 07:12 the controller cleared the crew for further descent to altitude 3400 ft. The aircraft was meanwhile crossing FL074. The crew was busy monitoring the flight altitude and was aware they were higher than the STAR chart.
The localizer was capture at 3600 ft agl. At that time the altitude should have been 1345 ft agl (3400 ft amsl).
At 07:15:21 after the crew confirmed capturing the localizer, the flight was handed over to Tower Control.
At a distance of 1.7 nm the aircraft reached 3400 ft amsl and the ALT HOLD OPER autopilot mode was engaged longitudinally. At that point the flight was already over 400 ft above the glideslope. The glideslope mode was armed (G/S MODE ARM), but the glideslope was not captured.
At 07:15:31 while the aircraft was in level flight at 3400 ft amsl Outer Marker overflight was recorded (as per the approach chart Outer Marker overflight altitude is 2800 ft amsl). 
A glideslope signal was captured at 07:15:52, at that time the aircraft was almost over VOR/DME MANAS at a distance of approximately 1.1 nm from the runway 26 threshold, at an angle of approximately 9°. However, as per the approach chart, the rated glideslope angle is 3°. The aircraft automatically initiated descent with a vertical speed of up to 1425 ft/min.
Six seconds after the glideslope capture LAND 3 autoland status annunciation was recorded. The crew called out the annunciation.
At 07:16:01 at 3300 ft amsl the aircraft crossed the Middle Marker (as per the approach chart MM overflight altitude is 2290 ft amsl). After  the  glideslope  descent  was  initiated  the  glideslope  pointer  was  fluctuating within - 4 to + 4 dots.
At 07:16:07, at 3150 ft amsl, AP CAUTION and FMA FAULT 2 events were recorded. These events were continuously recorded almost until the end of the flight. An FMA FAULT 2 means that the autopilot can no longer track the actual glideslope, but will track a constant 3° glide path until a valid glideslope signal is regained or until the crew intervenes by disengaging the autopilot or initiating a go-around.
As the aircraft was descending LAND 3 status degraded to LAND 2, which was confirmed by the crew callout. LAND 2 means that the autopilot flight director system redundancy is reduced to the use of only two of the three autopilots.
The EGPWS 'Glideslope' alert was then triggered 5 times. 
At 07:17:04 the flight crossed the runway 26 departure end at a height of about 110 ft. Decision height was 99 ft. The FO then called ""Minimums"" and the captain informed that there was no visual contact and called to go-around.
At 58 ft radar altitude the TOGA switch was pushed and engine power increased. 3.5 seconds after the TOGA switch had been pushed the aircraft hit slightly upsloping terrain and obstacles. The ground speed at the time of impact was 165 kt. The maximum recorded vertical acceleration was 6 g.
Initial impact occurred at a distance of approximately 930 m from the runway 26 departure end. It collided with a concrete airport fence and rolled into a holiday village. The aircraft broke up and spilt fuel caught fire.";07:19;Boeing 747-412F;ACT Airlines;Monday 16 January 2017

Russell Regional Airport (RMG), Georgia. The pilot was uninjured and the co-pilot received minor injuries. 
According to the crew, the automated surface observing system at the airport indicated the winds were variable at 6 knots. They requested and were cleared for the visual approach to runway 7, which was 4,495 feet-long.
While in the traffic pattern and abeam the runway numbers, the crew lowered the landing gear and deployed 20 degrees of flaps, followed by 30 degrees on the base leg. On final approach, the crew stated that the turbulence was moderate and the airspeed started fluctuate and decreased to Vref. They responded by adjusting engine power on short final, and noted that ""considerable power"" was necessary to maintain airspeed. The airplane touched down at the Vref speed of 112 kts inside the touchdown zone, but the ground speed appeared to be fast.
The crew activated the speed brakes, and the pilot applied the wheel brakes (the airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers). The crew then increased their braking to maximum, and when it was evident that the airplane not going to stop before the end of the runway, they activated the emergency brake. The airplane departed the end of the runway and travelled into the safety area, where it sank into the grass and mud as it continued forward in a slight left turn. The nose landing gear collapsed and the forward fuselage struck the ground resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. The airplane came to rest approximately 350 feet from the departure end of the runway.

One of the flight crew members of the aircraft stated to ASN that NO tailwind was involved, contrary to what ASN previously reported based on a statement from an airport spokesman in local media.

A few minutes before 8 o'clock in the morning the crew were cleared to descend from FL280 to FL100. The ice detection system was triggered during descent to FL100. Engine and airframe anti-icing systems were switched on simultaneously. FL100 was reached at 07:59:58 hrs. The pilots stated that they encountered icing conditions when the airplane entered the clouds. At FL100 ice is reported to have formed at the windscreen edges. Vibrations on the no. 2 engine increased temporarily after a flight time of six minutes at FL100. As the airplane was approximately 12.5 NM south of Munich airport, the crew was instructed to descend to FL90 and to change heading to 020 degrees. Heavy vibrations on the no. 2 engine occurred during descent. According to crew statements, the airbrakes were extended in order to increase thrust setting on the engines without increase in airspeed. Immediately afterwards the warning VIB HIGH ENG2 was triggered at FL90. The actions of the Abnormal Procedure Vibration High checklist were carried out. However, the no. 2 engine was not shut down for lack of other failure indications. Afterwards no more problems for the no. 2 engine were indicated. Simultaneously with the strong vibrations, vibrations and noises from the rear cabin area were heard in the cockpit. At 08:08:14 hrs the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped from 1.5 to 1.1 and stayed at about 1.0 after that. In the cockpit heavy vibrations had been noticed also and a rattling noise had been heard. But the vibrations were not displayed on the multifunctional display as originating from the engines. At 08:08:22 hrs, the captain declared an emergency because of severe engine problems and requested an immediate landing. The airplane was immediately cleared to descend to 5,000 ft based on a QNH of 1,017 hPa and to change to a heading of 080 degrees. The crew requested an approach as short as possible. While leaving FL90, the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped also from 1.4 to 1.0 within the next four minutes; this EPR reduction was incremental and occurred independent of the thrust setting. At 7,000 ft the air brakes were extended for a short time and engine thrust increased. During the descent to 5,000 ft the airplane was transferred to Munich Director. After 08:12:45 hrs when the airplane had reached approximately 5,000 ft the EPR of the no. 2 engine retained values of about 1.0 also. Munich Director immediately issued a clearance to further descend to 3,500 ft. The air brakes where extended again for a period of 44 seconds. Thereby the airspeed was reduced to approximately 170 kt. With the landing gears extended and the flaps set to 15 degrees, the airspeed was about 150 kt. The airplane was guided to the landing course of the ILS 26L approximately 8 NM in front of the threshold. At approximately 4,000 ft flaps were extended to 25 degrees. After the airplane had descended in landing configuration to the cleared altitude of 3,500 ft and horizontal flight had been established, the crew noticed that by pushing the thrust levers forward, the EPR on both engines did not increase to the required value. The speeds N1 and N2 and the exhaust gas temperatures (EGT) of both engines increased, the EPRs, however, remained at values of around 1.0. After the message of the crew that they were just approaching the ILS the flight was transferred to Munich Tower. Airspeed decreased to approximately 115 kt. The autopilot was immediately switched off, the airplane again established in descent, the flaps reset to 15 degrees and the landing gears retracted. Airspeed increased to approximately 135 kt. The flaps were again set to 25 degrees. The airplane received clearance to land. At 08:16:10 hrs the controller informed the crew that the Fokker was approximately 500 ft below the glide path. At this time the height measured by the radio altimeter was 500 ft AGL. At the same time the GPWS sounded: ""Too low"" and ""Gear"". The crew informed the controller that the runway could not be reached and that the landing would take place approximately 4 NM short of the runway: ""...We will not make it...to the runway...we are touching down probable 4 Miles before the field...""). From approximately 400 ft AGL downwards the airplane was clear of clouds. The landing gear was selected down 13 seconds prior to ground contact. The captain informed the cabin crew of the imminent emergency landing through the repeated exclamation ""Brace for impact"" 5 seconds prior to touch down. At 08:16:35 hrs, the airplane touched down on a snow covered field approximately 2.5 NM short of the runway with landing gears partly extended and came to rest severely damaged lying on the fuselage after a sliding distance of 220 m. All occupants left the airplane without assistance via the forward passenger door exit.";08:17;Fokker 70;Austrian Airlines;Monday 5 January 2004

The crew planned a non-precision automatic direction finder (ADF) approach to runway 25 at Lloydminster with an overcast ceiling of 400 feet, visibility of 5 statute miles in blowing snow and mist, and the wind from 110 degrees true at 7 knots. When the aircraft was inbound, the flight service station (FSS) specialist reported that the visibility had decreased to 3 sm. The crew were aware of approximately to ¼ inch build-up of ice on the aircraft during descent and so planned for a flap 20 landing. The first officer was flying the approach from the right-hand seat while the captain was monitoring the instruments and looking outside the aircraft for visual contact with the runway environment. When the captain saw the runway from the minimum descent altitude (MDA), he took control for the landing. The aircraft was north of the extended centre line of runway 25. Flaps 35 was selected, the power was reduced to flight idle, a turn to regain the centre line was carried out, and a descent was commenced from MDA. The aircraft contacted the runway surface heavily, moving left to right. As a result, the left main landing gear collapsed. Both propellers struck the runway, and the left propeller separated from the engine. The aircraft slid along the runway on the belly pod for a distance of about 1 800 feet. The left wing contacted the snow on the edge of the runway, resulting in a turn of about 160 degrees.

The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the student pilot were not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings from impact forces.
The student pilot was performing the takeoff. During the takeoff roll on runway 30, the airplane began to drift to the right, and the student applied left rudder to correct for the drift. The CFI advanced the right throttle during the ground roll in an attempt to counteract the right yaw. The tail wheel came off the ground about 80 knots, and the airplane swerved to the right. The CFI applied left rudder in an attempt to stop the yaw and drift. As the airplane was about to depart the runway, the pilots did not reduce the throttles or apply brakes as they felt that it would be safer to attempt to get airborne.
The airplane slowed as it departed the runway surface. It collided with a series of berms, which sheared off the left landing gear and left engine. The right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude.
The operator stated that the student pilot inadvertently set the rudder trim to the full right position when he adjusted the rudder pedals during the prestart checks. The rudder trim was in the full right position for the takeoff, and found in the same position upon post accident inspection.

Of the 50 occupants, five sustained serious injuries.
Alitalia flight AZ1670 had departed Pisa-Galileo Galilei Airport (PSA) on a domestic flight to Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO). This flight was operated by Carpatair on behalf of Alitalia. 
The airplane flew the approach in strong cross wind conditions with wind shear reported at runway 16L some fifteen minutes before the landing. Shortly before touchdown the airplane suddenly lost altitude and impacted the runway with the nose landing gear. This was at a distance of 567 meters from the runway threshold.
It bounced three times, causing the nose and main gear to collapse. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass near taxiway DE, at a distance of about 1780 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft had also performed a rotation on the vertical axis of 170°, thus assuming a definitive orientation of about 330° magnetic. It came to rest 400 m from fire station no. 1. However, it took the fire services ten minutes to reach the airplane because they were not aware of the precise location of the accident.

The airplane landed in strong winds from 250 degrees on runway 16L. Runway 25 at Fiumicino was Notamed not available for landings due to work in progress.
The Fiumicino Notam reported at the time of the accident of the following limitations of the runway 16L ILS:

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight which departed from Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, MN (MSP) at 11:39.
The flight to the DEN area was reported as routine, with VFR weather prevailing. At about 12:02, as the flight was entering the DEN terminal area, the crew briefed an approach speed of 139 knots for a visual approach to runway 16L. The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF) and reported the approach was stable at 1,000 feet above the runway threshold. At 12:16:15 ATC cleared the flight to land and issued a wind advisory of 260 degrees at 5 knots. The flight crew extended the gear and selected flaps 3.
The autopilot was disengaged at 12:17:38, at approximately 750 feet above touchdown. The auto-thrust and flight directors were engaged. During the approach, the crew noted that the aircraft was experiencing approximately 7 knots of tailwind, and as the approach progressed FDR data indicated the tailwind component increased to approximately 11 knots.
As the airplane passed approximately 50 feet above touchdown the rate of descent was about 800 feet per minute (fpm). The captain stated he expected nothing more than a firm touchdown. The FO initiated the flare at about 45 feet. He stated that he attempted to arrest the sink rate with larger than normal aft stick deflection. During the flare, passing 20 feet above the runway, the automated ""retard"" call-out began a sequence of three annunciations. This automatic call-out is designed to remind the pilot to move the thrust levers to the idle detent. The thrust levers remained in the climb detent (CLB).
During the flare, the airplane pitched up to about eight degrees nose up and airspeed decreased to about 132 knots. The airplane touched down on both main landing gear with a vertical load of about 1.56 G. At the time of initial touchdown, the thrust levers were still in CLB, and engine N1 increased from approximately 54% to 64% over 3 seconds.
Radio altimeter values increased, indicating the aircraft then bounced. The FO held 16 degrees aft stick input (approximately full aft travel), and moved the thrust levers to idle during the bounce. Ground spoilers deployed (thrust lever position and wheel spin up logic was satisfied) and the airplane touched down a second time in an eleven degree nose up attitude, with FO still applying full aft stick input. At this point the captain began adding some nose down stick input however pitch attitude continued increasing to about 12.5 degrees nose up. The Airbus FCOM indicates that the max pitch up angle with gear compressed is 11.7 degrees. A ""dual input"" automatic call-out was recorded, indicating the system detected both pilots making stick inputs, and the sound of a loud bang was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. As the captain stick input moved further forward, in the airplane nose down direction, and the FO stick back pressure relaxed, the airplane began to pitch downward and about 3 seconds after the loud bang the nose wheel touched down. Thrust levers were then moved to the reverse position and autobraking began. The remainder of the roll out was normal.
The aircraft experienced heavy abrasions, dents and perforations of the skin along the lower rear fuselage between frames 62 and 76. Additionally, the aft galley drain mast and two aircraft antennas were broken, and the APU air intake sustained damage. The rear pressure bulkhead damage was buckled and cracked. The lower segment of frame 70 was cracked and had heavy abrasions. Interior damage also consisted of minor deformation of frames, damage to stringers, frame clips, fasteners, floor support strut fittings and flange.";12:18;Airbus A320-211;Northwest Airlines;Monday 4 May 2009

Applying takeoff thrust, parts of asphalt were torn off, striking the left side of the horizontal stabilizer. Takeo off was continued with the crew unaware of the extent of damage. After landing serious damage to the tail was revealed.
None of the passengers and crew suffered any injuries.

The aircraft was repaired and test flown on May 16 before returning to service on May 17, 2015.

The crew reported the en route portion of the flight was uneventful. As the airplane approached RIL, the crew checked the automated surface observing system (ASOS) report which reported the sky overcast at 4,000 feet and no rain. During the downwind leg to runway 26, the crew could see the runway. Prior to the final approach fix for the ILS approach to runway 26 and approximately 8 miles from the airport, the crew had the runway in sight. The crew communicated their intentions on the RIL common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The pilot flew the airplane on the glideslope approximately Vref (Final Approach Speed) 128 knots plus 10-15 knots, then below 1,000 feet, Vref plus 10 knots. The pilot stated that the airplane touched down approximately 1,500 feet from the approach end of runway 26. The co-pilot reported the airbrake was in the #2 position and they had ""good anti-skid indication"" after touchdown. The pilot ""began braking, deployed the thrust reverser, and continued to increase brake pressure as it didn't seem like a normal deceleration rate. With approximately 2,500 feet of runway remaining, the airplane continued to not decelerate normally, and the pilot knew they did not have enough runway to execute a go-around. With approximately 1,000 feet of runway remaining, the pilot pulled the parking brake to the second detent, and the aircraft slid off the end of the runway into the dirt and muddy terrain. It came to rest 268 feet past the runway end. The right main landing gear trunnion had sheared from its attach points, rotated up and punctured wing skin. The main landing gear strut impacted the aft spar and sheared rib 3, which compromised the wing fuel tank.

The aircraft was extensively damaged as a result of the collapse. No injuries were sustained by the pilot or passengers from the accident. 
Approximately two hours earlier, the aircraft was chartered to fly from Perth to Mount Hale, WA when shortly after takeoff from Perth the aircraft experienced a malfunction of the landing gear system. The main wheels and nose gear had become jammed and were unable to fully retract when selected up by the pilot. 
The pilot completed the emergency checklist actions contained in the Aircraft Flight Manual, but was unable to retract or extend the gear using either the automated control or the manual emergency system. The pilot then requested assistance from a passenger to operate the manual emergency extension system. 
The landing gear remained jammed despite the additional force applied to the lever from the passenger. 
The pilot contacted air traffic services and requested further assistance from company engineering personnel to visually assess the extension state of the landing gear. Two aerodrome passes were completed throughout the troubleshooting exercise and the pilot remained in radio contact with both groups during this phase. 
Following the flyovers and after holding over Rottnest Island at 5,000 ft for a period of approximately two hours, the pilot flew the King Air back to Perth airport. 
With the gear still jammed in the partially retracted position, both the left and right main landing gear assemblies collapsed after the aircraft touched down on runway 24. The aircraft was substantially damaged as a result of the collapse.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation revealed that two major system components had failed which could have prevented the landing gear from properly retracting/extending; the geared components within the right main landing gear actuator had fractured, and the left torque tube support bearing had seized from contamination and lack of lubrication. Although each component failure was apparently unrelated, the examination was not able to conclusively establish which failure had been the primary contributing factor in this landing occurrence. The Super King Air 200 aircraft landing gear system configuration was such that should either one of these component assemblies cease to function, extension or retraction of the landing gear would not have been possible.";17:03;Beechcraft B200 Super King Air;Network Aviation Australia;Monday 9 April 2007

The airplane was flying straight and level, at about 120 miles per hour (mph), at an altitude of about 2,500 feet, and heading northeast at the time of impact with the eagle. The flight crew notified the Homer Flight Service Station of the bird strike and their intentions to return to base. At this time, the airplane was flying normal with no control issues. However, the first attempt at landing was aborted due to an uncontrollable aileron roll to the left when the airspeed decayed below 75 mph. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested emergency services. During the subsequent landing, the flight crew maintained the airspeed above 75 mph until an altitude that was just above the surface of the water.

WestJet flight WS2425, a Boeing 737-800 registered C-FDMB, landed on runway 24R at 17:39 hours local time following a flight from Cancún, Mexico. The flight taxied to Terminal 3 and was stopped with the engines and APU running, on Taxi-lane 2 on the north side of Pier B. The flight crew were waiting for ground personnel to marshal the aircraft into position at Gate B12.
The WestJet aircraft was positioned directly behind and perpendicular to a Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800 (C-FPRP), which was parked at Gate B13. 
The Sunwing aircraft was being prepared to be towed to another location at the airport. A Sunwing maintenance technician was in the cockpit of C-FPRP, and the aircraft's APU was running. Two ground personnel were in the cab of the tow vehicle. The tow vehicle was informed by the North Apron controller to pushback at their discretion.
The Sunwing aircraft (under tow) began to move back and the APU contacted the right wing of the stationary WestJet aircraft. A fire rapidly ensued. The WestJet flight crew immediately commenced the required steps for an evacuation, and an evacuation was ordered shortly after. The tow vehicle operator pulled the Sunwing aircraft back towards the gate to separate the two aircraft.
The slides on the WestJet aircraft were utilized on doors L1, R1 and L2, along with the over-wing exits on the left side; all passengers evacuated safely. The maintenance technician aboard the Sunwing aircraft exited the left cockpit window using the emergency rope and received minor injuries.

The pilot stated that he was high and fast during the descent into Las Vegas but that the approach was ""stable"" by 500 feet. He stated that he maintained his Vref speed of 112 knots from there until touchdown. 
The passenger stated that he felt that the approach was ""fast"" and that the pilot was ""behind the power curve"" because of high minimum enroute altitudes in the area and that they had to ""hustle down"" during the descent. The passenger indicated that the flight crossed the runway threshold ""maybe a bit more"" that 10 knots above Vref and touched down about 10 knots above Vref. He said it was not a stabilized approach.
Landing distance calculations and other evidence suggest that the lift dump panels did not extend after landing; however, the investigation did not determine the reason(s) for the lack of lift dump. No evidence was found of any failures affecting the lift dump or braking systems. Evidence and interview statements reveal that the pilot flew an unstabilized approach to the runway and landed well above target speed. The high landing speed was result of the pilot's excessive airspeed on the approach and a tailwind component of about 8 knots. Although the pilot landed the airplane within the touchdown area, the airplane's speed upon touchdown was about 17 knots above the prescribed speed. After exiting the end of runway 7, the airplane continued and impacted a perimeter fence and came to rest approximately 735 feet beyond the end of runway.";15:57;Raytheon 390 Premier I;Raytheon Aircraft;Thursday 27 May 2004

The pilot and eight passengers were killed.
The accident airplane was the third of four Promech-operated float-equipped airplanes that departed at approximate 5-minute intervals from a floating dock in Rudyerd Bay. The accident flight and the two Promech flights that departed before it were carrying cruise-ship passengers who had a 12:30 ""all aboard"" time for their cruise ship that was scheduled to depart at 13:00. The sightseeing tour flight, which the cruise ship passengers had purchased from the cruise line as a shore excursion, overflew remote inland fjords; coastal waterways; and mountainous, tree-covered terrain in the Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness.
Promech pilots could choose between two standard tour routes between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan, referred to as the ""short route"" (which is about 52 nautical miles, takes about 25 minutes to complete, and is primarily over land) and the ""long route"" (which is about 63 nm, takes about 30 minutes to complete, and is primarily over seawater channels). Although the long route  was less scenic, it was generally preferred in poor weather conditions because it was primarily over water, which enabled the pilots to fly at lower altitudes beneath cloud layers. Route choice was at each pilot's discretion based on the pilot's assessment of the weather. The accident pilot and two other Promech pilots (one of whom was repositioning an empty airplane) chose the short route for the return leg, while the pilot of the second Promech flight to depart chose the long route. 
The accident flight encountered deteriorating weather conditions with terrain becoming obscured by overcast clouds with visibility restricted in rain and mist.
Although the accident pilot had climbed the airplane to an altitude that would have provided safe terrain clearance had he followed the typical short route (which required the flight to pass two nearly identical mountains before turning west), the pilot instead deviated from that route and turned the airplane west early (after it passed only the first of the two mountains). The pilot's route deviation placed the airplane on a collision course with a 1,900-ft mountain, which it struck at an elevation of about 1,600 ft mean sea level. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up rapidly before colliding with terrain. The timing of this aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions, and, as soon as he realized that the flight was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in an ineffective attempt to avoid the terrain.";12:16;de Havilland Canada DHC-3T Vazar Turbine Otter;Promech Air;Thursday 25 June 2015

The conditions were below VFR minimums, which were required to conduct the passenger-carrying commercial flight in a single-engine airplane. The conditions later improved and the pilot departed under a special VFR clearance. The pilot performed two approaches at the Wainwright Airport (AIN) in IMC that were consistent with the two GPS approaches that were available there. Weather data and witnesses indicate that daylight conditions, low clouds and poor visibility prevailed, with cloud tops at 1,000 feet. After the second approach, the pilot radioed that he was heading back to the departure airport because he could not see the airport. The airplane impacted the frozen Arctic Ocean in a right bank and at a 60-degree nose-down attitude about three miles away from the location of the pilot's last radio transmission. An examination of the airplane before it sank through cracking ice, revealed no pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.

The airplane was operated by the pilot as a familiarization flight. The commercial pilot and sole passenger were not injured. The airplane departed the Upland-Cable Airport, California, about 11:45. 
The pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight was a familiarization flight for a new member of their chapter of the Commemorative Air Force. The flight departed the Cable airport and flew east along the mountains, headed to San Bernardino. They contacted the San Bernardino tower and were instructed to enter the crosswind for runway 24. As part of the before landing checklist, the pilot turned on the carburetor heat and switched the fuel tank selector to the right fuel tank. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. The pilot attempted numerous times to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful. 
The pilot realized that he would not be able to reach the airport, and decided to make a forced landing to a small field in a residential area. During the landing approach, the airplane contacted a power line. After touching down in the field the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage.

During the postaccident examination of the airplane, about 16 ounces of water were removed from the fuel system.  Water was present in the lower gascolator, the fine fuel filter (upper gascolator), and subsequent fuel line to the carburetor inlet.  A brass screen at the carburetor inlet and 2 carburetor fuel bowl thumb screens also contained corrosion, water, and rust.  
The approved aircraft inspection checklist called for washing the carburetor and main fuel filter every 50 hours and cleaning and/or replacing the fine fuel filter every 100 hours.  The fine fuel filter is not easily accessible and not able to be drained during a preflight inspection. The mechanic who completed the most recent inspection stated that he did not drain or check the fine fuel filter.

Less than three minutes after departure at an altitude of 5900 feet and an airspeed of 250 knots, the no. 1 engine failed. The captain decided to return to the airfield. Preparing for the approach to runway 10, the flaps were set at 8 degrees and the landing gear was extended. Because the aircraft was above the glideslope, power was reduced to idle and the flaps were lowered to 20 and a little later further down to 40 degrees. At that moment the airspeed dropped considerably. The thrust lever of the remaining right hand engine was then advanced to near takeoff power. Due to the asymmetric thrust the plane yawed to the left at a height of 200-300 feet. The captain ordered the first officer to raise the flaps back to the 20 degree position.

According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. Both pilots indicated that takeoff through the initial descent was uneventful. The aircraft was configured for a flaps 30 landing. During the ILS approach to runway 25L, the captain used the Heads-up Guidance System (HGS) in the IMC mode. 
During the decent below 100 feet, the FO indicated that the runway environment was dark and sensed the runway was ""coming close fast"". He noted a slightly increased descent rate and before he could make a callout, the captain had begun to take corrective action. 
During the descent, the captain stated he was hand flying the airplane (autopilot and autothrottles were off) and used the localizer, glideslope and flare cues from the HGS. At approximately 30 feet, he transitioned from the HGS to the runway environment, noting it appeared ""pitch black."" He then noticed the runway edge lights and what appeared to be an increased sink rate.
Both pilots indicated the airplane touched down firm, then bounced, and the second touch down was harder than the first. Neither were aware that they had struck the tail. The captain did not recall seeing a tail strike warning indication from the HGS.
Post flight inspection revealed that the tail strike indicator was compressed and deep scrapes and wear damage to the lower aft fuselage skin. Further investigation revealed multiple fractured frames and buckled stringers, shear ties and straps.

The airplane was ferried unpressurized from Las Vegas to Phoenix, AZ (PHX) on January 13 and continued the next day to Seattle-Paine Field, WA. The airplane was repaired and back in service on February 27.";ca 19:30;Boeing 737-8H4 (WL);Southwest Airlines;Friday 3 January 2014

When it went dark en route to Mwanza, the radio altimeter integral light was found to be unserviceable. The crew were not able to fix the problem and the continued using the FMS. The crew contacted Mwanza tower at 16:58 and were being advised that there was no power at the airport and that efforts were being made to use a standby generator. Further information passed on the crew reportedly included VOR, DME and NDB all unserviceable, weather: wind calm, 8 km visibility, temperature 25deg C and QNH 1015. After holding for 10 minutes, the airport generator came on and the runway lights went on. The first officer, who was pilot flying, started a visual runway 12 approach. When well established on finals with full landing configuration, the captain told the f/o that he was too low, and a few seconds later he told the f/o he was too high. Both the captain and the flight engineer then told the f/o to go around. The f/o overshot and climbed to 5500 feet on the downwind leg. Turning on the left base the captain remarked that the turn was too tight: "".. I will do a 360-degree turn to the right and position you finals"". The captain thus took over control and started a right turn at 4400 feet. Just before completing the turn, the f/o said: ""do not go down anymore, the altimeter is reading 4100 feet"".

During the takeoff roll, the aircraft was pulling to the left of the runway centreline, and the right rudder was required to maintain takeoff alignment. Two minutes later the flight was cleared to climb to 16,000 feet. 
At 07:13, the crew advised the controller of a decrease in hydraulic pressure and requested to return to the departure airport, Dorval. The controller immediately gave clearance for a 180° turn and descent to 8000 feet. At 07:13:36, something was wrong with the controls. Shortly afterward came the first perceived indication that engine trouble was developing, and the left wing overheat light illuminated about 40 seconds later. Within 30 seconds the light went out. At 07:18:12, the left engine appeared to be on fire, and it was shut down. Less than one minute later, the captain took the controls because abnormal right aileron pressure was required to keep the aircraft on heading. At 07:19 ATC suggested the crew to proceed to Mirabel instead of Dorval, which they accepted. Less than a minute and a half later, the crew informed ATC that flames were coming out of the ""engine nozzle"". At 07:23:10, the crew informed ATC that the left engine was no longer on fire, but three and a half minutes later, they advised ATC that the fire had started again. During this time, the aircraft was getting harder to control in roll, and the aileron trim was set at the maximum. Around 07:27, when the aircraft was on short final for runway 24, the landing gear lever was selected, but only two gear down indicator lights came on. Near the runway threshold, the left wing failed upwards. The aircraft then rotated more than 90° to the left around its longitudinal axis and crashed, inverted, on the runway.

At 10:33:34 the first officer pulled the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle and observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated. The alternate gear indication lights in the floor near the nose gear release handle agreed with the primary gear indication lights on the flight deck panel.
After the Alternate Gear Extension Procedure was completed, the crew could hear the nose gear door was ""flapping loosely"". The flight crew conducted a low approach and air traffic control tower personnel advised them that the nose gear doors appeared to be open but the nose gear did not appear to be down.
At 10:56:52 the captain briefed the cabin crew members and advised them that an evacuation, if necessary, would be conducted using the forward doors. The flight crew configured the airplane for landing at flaps 35 on runway 9 with the main landing gear down, and the nose landing gear retracted.
At 11:07:46, after passing through about 1,000 feet on approach, the first officer made a ""brace"" call over the passenger address system. The main gear touched down at 11:08:50 and the captain held the nose off the runway until the airplane slowed to about 80 knots. Once the nose touched down, there were sparks and smoke resulting from the fuselage scraping the runway and the airplane came to a stop at about 11:09. The captain ordered an evacuation and the pilots performed the On Ground Emergencies checklist. The passengers and crew evacuated through the forward cabin doors and were bussed to the terminal.";11:08;de Havilland Canada DHC-8-402 Q400;null;Wednesday 4 July 2012

At 15:18, the aircraft landed slightly left of the runway centre line. According to the crew the aircraft started skidding left to right. The crew further reported that, as the brakes were applied, they noticed the aircraft oscillating left and right. The oscillation increased continuously until eventually the aircraft finally swivelled on the right shoulder of the runway where it came to a complete stop on a Magnetic Heading of 160°.

Flights were planned to verify the fuel flow rates for those tanks. Prior to departure, both flight crews decided that they would join-up after departure in order to take video and still photography of each airplane. N3735W and N372AC departed Milwaukee (MKE) at 15:55 and 16:15, respectively. After departure and clearing MKE airspace, the flight crew of N372AC established radio and visual contact with N3735W. N3735W then proceeded to perform several fly-bys past N372AC who remained on constant headings and altitude. N3735W then came up along the other Shorts' left side and flew in formation with approximately 100-150 feet lateral separation. A pilot of N3735W then announced over the radio that they would turn right and descend below N372AC. During that manoeuver N3735W's left wing impacted the left wing and engine of the other plane. The captain of N372AC attempted to climb in an attempt to avoid impacting N3735W. The outboard 3/4 of the left wing of N3735W separated and the airplane crashed out of control, into a field southeast of the intersection of Highway Q and Highway 19 and caught fire. After the collision, N372AC rolled to the left and pitched down significantly before the flight crew regained control of the airplane. The flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Juneau-Dodge County Airport, WI (UNU) for an emergency landing. N372AC experienced a complete hydraulic failure and was losing hydraulic fluid. The flight crew performed an emergency landing on runway 08 (5,069 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) with flaps retracted and a partially extended landing gear.

The plane's pilot and two other crew members were members of the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard
It appeared that the pilot's decision to go to the bathroom shifted the weight of the already unbalanced plane and caused it to become unstable and uncontrollable while in an area of strong turbulence. The nose of the plane slowly pitched up and then abruptly dropped just before the crash. In three seconds, the plane rose more than 100 feet with its nose down, and was then rocked by wind shear three times greater than what is defined as extreme turbulence. Within the first 12 seconds that they encountered problems, the G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight. It was also established that the weather radar was underpowered, negatively impacting the ability of the crew to successfully circumnavigate around the severe weather.

extinguishers, but a slight smell of smoke was noticed by the cabin crew and flight crew. Flight 116 landed and stopped on the runway to allow airport
firefighters to inspect the aircraft for fire. Firefighters, using infrared sensing equipment, did not detect any sign of fire. The flight crew taxied the aircraft to the terminal but stopped approximately 40 feet back from the gate to allow firefighters to open the aft cargo compartment for a detailed inspection. When the cargo door was opened, a significant amount of smoke was observed. Firefighters entered the cargo compartment and confirmed that the fire had been extinguished. TSB investigators discovered that an intense but relatively small fire had occurred, causing significant structural damage in the floor area of the aft
cargo compartment. Before it was extinguished, the fire had progressed approximately 18 inches up the right side wall of the aircraft, outside the aft cargo compartment. The cargo bay fire-extinguishing system, a Halon-based system, effectively suppressed the fire before it could spread further. The fire appears to have been a direct result of an electrical failure of a heater tape used to prevent water lines from freezing. The electrical failure of the heater tape ignited the covering of the insulation blankets installed below the open cargo floor and some debris found in the area.";17:37 EDT;Boeing 767-3Y0ER;Air Canada;Monday 13 May 2002

The ATR 72-500 operated as scheduled passenger flight from Medan with intended destination of Meulaboh Airport. On board IW1252 were two pilots, one observer pilot, two flight attendants and 67 passengers. The pilot in command acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the second in command acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM).
At 10:54, the flight attendant of IW1252 advised the pilot that the boarding process was completed. The pilot then requested push back and engine start clearance from the Medan Ground controller , which was approved.
At 10:56, IW1252 requested taxi clearance to the Medan Ground controller and was instructed to taxi to runway 23 following U2 taxi route, which was from apron V to holding point runway 23 on taxiway C, via taxiway U - T - and B.
At 10:57, flight JT197 reported to the Medan Tower controller that the aircraft was established on the localizer of runway 23. The Medan Tower controller acknowledged this and issued a landing clearance with additional information regarding the wind conditions and barometric pressure.
At 10:58, IW1252 contacted Medan Tower and was instructed to continue to taxi and hold on short of runway 23. Flight IW1252 requested to depart via the taxiway D intersection with the intention to expedite the departure. This was approved. Taxiway D was a Rapid Exit Taxiway (RET) for runway 05.
At 10:59, IW1252 advised Medan Tower that the aircraft was close to reaching runway 23. Medan Tower then requested confirmation that IW1252 was ready for immediate departure. There was no reply and the Medan Tower controller repeated the request and received the reply that IW1252 was able for immediate departure.
Medan Tower intended to let IW1252 depart immediately after flight JT197 had landed, since there was another arriving aircraft behind JT197.
At 11:00:01, the Medan Tower controller radioed: ""Wings Abadi one two five two behind traffic Lion short final landed passing line up behind runway two three from intersection delta additional clearance after departure direct Meulaboh"".
At 11:00:13, IW1252 read back: ""after departure direct to Meulaboh Wings Abadi one two five two"". Thereafter, IW1252 continued the taxi for line up on runway 23.
At 11:00:32, IW1252 crossed the runway holding position marking (yellow line). At the same time, the Medan Tower controller was monitoring the distance of the second arriving aircraft on the radar display.
As JT197 was on short final, the flight crew noted IW1252 ahead and assumed that the ATR aircraft would not enter the runway. Therefore, the PF decided to continue the landing approach and focused on handling the aircraft.
At 11:00:50, JT197 touched down and the attention of the Medan Tower controller changed back from the radar display to the runway environment.
IW1252 by then crossed the runway side marking (white line) and continued to enter the runway. The flight crew of JT197 saw that the ATR was entering the runway.
At 11:00:56, the left wing of JT197 impacted with the right hand wing of IW1252.
The flight crew of JT197 subsequently radioed the Medan Tower controller that there was another aircraft on the runway and this was acknowledged. The Medan Tower supervisor on duty noticed two aircraft on the runway and the Medan Tower controller panicked. Thereafter, the Medan Tower supervisor took over the communication of Medan Tower.
At 11:01:47, the pilot of JT197 contacted the Medan Tower twice, and received a response at 11:02:01 by the Medan Tower supervisor, who then instructed them to vacate the runway via taxiway G.
At 11:02:05, JT197 advised the Medan Tower that the aircraft had touched down and asked why there was another aircraft on runway 23. The Medan Tower supervisor requested the pilot to standby.
At 11:02:30, the Medan Tower supervisor instructed the other arriving aircraft pilot to overshoot due to traffic. The other arriving aircraft pilot requested to make orbit to the left on final approach which was approved.
While the Boeing 737-900 was taxiing to the parking bay, the Medan Tower supervisor issued takeoff clearance to IW1252, with additional clearance to turn left heading 315 after airborne. IW1252 responded that they were unable to depart. The Medan Tower supervisor then instructed the IW1252 pilot to hold on the runway. 
At 11:04:40, the Medan Tower supervisor again issued takeoff clearance IW1252, to which the pilot responded by requesting to return to the apron for inspection of any damage to the aircraft. The Medan Tower supervisor approved the request and instructed them to vacate the runway via taxiway E then to contact Medan Ground.
As the ATR was taxiing back to the apron another departing aircraft was cleared to line up on runway 23, with takeoff clearance being issued at 11:07:21. 
At 11:08:55, JT197 advised the Medan Ground controller pf the possibility of aircraft debris on the runway that might become hazard to the other aircraft. The Medan Ground controller acknowledged and relayed the information to Medan Tower supervisor. At 11:10:26, the flight that had just departed advised Medan Tower that there was Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on the runway. 
Despite these reports, Medan Tower issued landing clearance to another arriving aircraft at 11:10:44.
At 11:14, after landing on runway 23, the other arriving flight advised Medan Tower that there was FOD on the runway. It took until 11:31 for the runway to be closed. After all the debris were collected and runway cleaned, the runway was reopened and resumed to normal operation at 11:55.";11:00;ATR 72-212A (ATR-72-500);Wings Air;Thursday 3 August 2017

During a step climb from FL360 to FL380 en route to LAX, the pilots noted that the No. 1 engine was lagging the right engine by about 2 percent. The flight landed at LAX at 09:37. After the passengers had disembarked, the plane was towed to hangar no. 2 and was parked outside. Maintenance personnel were going to conducting a ground run to troubleshoot the reported discrepancy. Several engine runups to maximum power were performed on both engines. Then they did two runups to max power of just the no. 1 engine. When retarding the throttle to idle, the engine experienced an uncontained rupture of the high pressure turbine (HPT) stage 1 disk. Debris punctured the fuselage and fell onto adjacent runway and taxiways. Runway 25R and Taxiways B and C were closed for several hours until the investigation and collection of the debris could be accomplished. The engine caught fire and the plane sustained significant damage to the left wing, fuselage, and tail section.;12:27;Boeing 767-223ER;American Airlines;Friday 2 June 2006

After leveling off at 5,500 feet msl, the crew noticed that the right engine cylinder head temperature and oil temperature was about 10 degrees above normal. Shortly after, both pilots noticed a sharp decrease in the right engine brake mean effective pressure followed by vibration in the engine. A fire started around the front lower cylinders. The captain feathered the right engine propeller, pulled the Emergency handle and fired the main and reserve fire extinguishing bottles. The fire however had extended to the whole front of the engine cylinders. The burning engine fell off the plane's wing and the crew prepared for a ditching. The co-pilot handed a life jacket to the pilot and then put his on. The pilot placed his life preserver to the side and did not put it on. While descending the co-pilot opened his side window, but the pilot did not. At 300 feet, and still on a westerly heading, the co-pilot recalled that the airplane's indicated airspeed was around 135 to 140 knots, and the right wing leading edge was on fire and was melting.

However, the flight crew stated that before departure from Atlanta (ATL), they looked at a computerized weather display and observed a line of adverse weather conditions along their intended route of flight. During initial climb after takeoff, the flight crew noticed that they were approaching a line of thunderstorms. The captain initially planned to fly around this line but noticed a 10-mile gap in the line that was depicted on the airplane's on-board weather radar display. The captain decided to fly through the gap, which he could also see when he looked outside of the airplane. Radar and weather data indicate that the airplane penetrated an extreme weather echo (VIP level 6) that likely contained a severe thunderstorm, hail, and severe to extreme turbulence. The thunderstorm top was above 45,000 feet. Neither the flight attendants nor the passengers received an adequate or timely briefing to remain seated and to prepare for the possibility of turbulence. The aft flight attendant and a passenger were seriously injured during the turbulence encounter. Hail shattered the front windshield and damaged the pitot system, radome, wings, tail, and engines. The flight crew successfully performed an emergency landing at Chattanooga-Lovell Field, TN (CHA). The investigation revealed that the captain had been involved in two other air carrier incidents involving adverse weather conditions. It also revealed that the airline lacked adequate training and guidance regarding hazardous weather interpretation and avoidance, as well as adequate procedures to notify flight attendants about potential turbulence. According to FAA guidance, flight crews should avoid intense or extreme level radar echoes by at least 20 miles. This guidance also instructs pilots that such echoes should be separated by at least 40 miles before flight is attempted between the echoes.;19:20;McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32;AirTran Airways;Thursday 7 May 1998

The seven crew members escaped unhurt.
The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Jeddah. During the flight, the captain discussed the use of manual spoilers during landing with the first officer. He further stated that; as he ""had only around 400 hours in the aircraft"" as a captain, he wanted to ""see the effect' of landing with manual spoilers. He further explained that the flight provided an opportunity to ""do it manually"" (use manual spoilers) as it was a repositioning flight and, the weather and dry runway conditions were ideal. As such, he discussed the procedure with the first officer and elected to land with the auto ground spoiler system unarmed.
The flight was uneventful. During the approach to Riyadh the Landing Checklist was completed, which included the arming of the auto ground spoiler system for landing. After the Landing Checklist was completed, the captain disarmed the auto ground spoiler system with the intention of applying manual ground spoilers after landing. The auto braking system was also not armed prior to landing.
The final approach and touchdown to runway 15 Left at Riyadh were uneventful. The touchdown airspeed was 135 knots calibrated air speed (CAS). 
On touchdown, the captain manually extended the spoiler/speed brake lever, but did not latch it in the fully extended (EXT) position (fully aft and latched upwards). The captain then removed his right hand from the speed brake lever in order to deploy the thrust reversers. The first officer noted the movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever and called ""Spoilers Deployed"". 
Since the spoiler/speed brake lever was not fully pulled aft and latched upwards, the lever automatically returned to the forward retracted (RET) position. This movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever was not noticed by the captain and the first officer. In response, the ground spoilers re-stowed before being fully deployed and, a speed brake/flap configuration (SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG) Level 1 Amber Alert occurred. This alert occurred as the aircraft was not yet fully weight on wheels (WOW) and the aircraft still sensed a flight condition with speed brakes deployed and flaps extended beyond six degrees.
Six seconds after touchdown on the right main landing gear, the nose gear touched down and the aircraft transferred to a ground condition (WOW on nose gear and main wheel spin up). The SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG alert extinguished when the nose gear oleo actuated ground shift on landing. 
After touchdown, the aircraft banked to the right and began to drift right of the runway centerline. In response, he applied left rudder, deployed the thrust reversers and applied left aileron.
But this did not have any noticeable effect.
The captain saw the approaching G4 taxiway exit and in an attempt to keep the aircraft from leaving the runway surface beyond the G4 taxiway exit, he decided to direct the aircraft towards the taxiway. He then applied a right rudder input which caused the aircraft to commence a rapid sweeping turn to the right towards the G4 taxiway exit.
The aircraft left the runway at high speed, traversed the full width of the G4 taxiway, and exited the surface at its southern edge. The aircraft then entered a sand section and travelled the distance infield between the edge of the G4 taxiway and the adjacent section of taxiway GOLF. The left main landing gear collapsed during this time. The aircraft came to rest on taxiway GOLF.

There were no injuries.
According to the pilot of N328BA, the aircraft's wings and tail section were partially deiced at the ramp by ramp personnel before they ran out of de-icing fluid. He received taxi clearance from ramp control and asked the de-icing crew to meet him on the south end of taxiway A to finish de-icing the remainder of the aircraft. He received instructions to hold short on taxiway A, and to contact ground control. Prior to reaching the taxiway hold short lines, he contacted ground control and received a clearance to taxi to runway 17R via taxiway M. He stated that because he received clearance to taxi to the runway, he did plan on stopping at the hold short lines. 
Immediately after receiving his taxi clearance, he realized he had forgotten to advise ramp control that he needed to deice the aircraft. At that time, he looked up and noticed that N151SA had stopped in front of him. He stated that he applied brake pressure, but was unable to stop. Upon impact, the left propeller of N328BA struck the tail section of N151SA, causing substantial damage to the left side of the fuselage of N151SA extending from the cargo door aft. In addition, the right flap of N151SA was damaged by N328BA's nose section.

At the same time, a Boeing 767-338ER operated by Qantas was stationary on taxiway Echo and waiting in line to depart from runway 16. The tail section of the 767 was protruding into taxiway Alpha while it was stationary on taxiway Echo awaiting a clearance to enter the runway.
The pilots of the 747 received a clearance to taxi, which included a taxi route from the international apron to the holding point on taxiway Bravo, for a departure from runway 16, via taxiways Uniform then Alpha. The pilot in command of the 747 deviated from the taxi clearance issued by the surface movement controller and turned the 747 right into taxiway Echo, to pass behind the 767. The left wing tip of the 747 collided with the right horizontal stabiliser of the 767 as the 747 crew attempted to manoeuvre behind the 767.

The taxiway dimensions and markings at Melbourne Airport complied with international standards and were suitable for use by the aircraft types involved in the occurrence.

The 747 crew was aware of the 767, and chose to pass behind it rather than wait on taxiway Alpha until the 767 was no longer obstructing the taxiway. The decision by the pilot in command of the 747 to deviate off the centreline of taxiway Alpha and taxi behind the 767 did not comply with the taxi clearance issued by the SMC. It was based on his assessment that it was safe to do so. The pilot in command of the 747 misjudged the distance between the wingtip of the 747 and the right horizontal stabiliser of the 767, which resulted in the collision.";13:08;Boeing 747-422;United Airlines;Thursday 2 February 2006

The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, received minor injuries. 
The flight originated at Parker, Arizona, about 17:54, and was destined for Palomar, California. The pilot was receiving VFR advisories from SOCAL Tracon en route to Palomar. The pilot became nauseous en route and began to vomit. At 1838, he advised SOCAL that he was sick and radio contact was lost. He reported that he had removed his headset and turned on the external speaker. The airplane had descended from 16,500 feet msl and was on an established course to the destination. It was level at 10,500 feet msl and being flown by the autopilot. As the vomiting became nonproductive the pilot became light headed. The last thing that he recalled was approaching ""ESCON,"" an intersection on the landing approach to Palomar. When the pilot regained consciousness he looked outside the airplane to determine where he was. The surface was obscured in cloud cover. On his left side was a Navy F-18 fighter plane. The F-18 pilot was communicating by hand signals, asking if he was ok, and indicated he should turn around towards land. The accident pilot determined that he was 186 nautical miles southwest of his destination, and over the ocean. He disconnected the autopilot and started a right-hand turn to reverse his course. After reversing course and checking his instruments, he determined that he was very low on fuel and did not have enough to make his destination. The pilot repeatedly attempted contact with Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control (SOCAL), but without success. Another aircraft on the coast responded and stated that they would relay the pilot's message to SOCAL. The pilot declared a medical emergency and advised that he would not be able to return to land.
Within 10 minutes the fuel onboard was exhausted and the pilot configured the airplane for the best angle of glide and ditching at sea. Subsequently, the pilot descended through low stratus and ditched the airplane in the ocean at dusk, about 19:45, on the Mission Bay Vortac 237-degree radial at 160 miles.
The pilot exited the airplane with a hand held VHF radio, two flashlights, a cell phone, and a trash bag for flotation, and climbed onto the top of the fuselage to await rescue. At this time it was dark. He verified that his emergency locator transmitter was operating with his VHF radio. After about 30 minutes, a Navy S-3B circled the area. After the third circle of the area the search plane saw the pilot's flashlight and circled the downed plane until a rescue helicopter arrived. A Navy frogman was dropped into the water and subsequently the pilot was hoisted onboard the helicopter. 
While at the pilot's Arizona residence, earlier that day, he had sprayed for bugs and insects using a pesticide ""Dursban."" During the process he opened the container to replenish the pesticide and the built-up pressure sprayed the vapors into his face. After cleaning himself up he departed for the airport and the return to Palomar. During the flight he ate some food that he had brought onboard, and shortly thereafter, became sick in flight. The Environmental Protection Agency, as of June 8, 2000, has banned Dursban from the commercial market.";19:45;Beechcraft B200 King Air;Calico Ventures LLC;Tuesday 23 May 2000

At 16:57 the flight crew contacted the controller at La Serena, reporting 31 nautical miles North of the Serena VOR. They were cleared to carry out a visual approach with a right hand base leg to runway 30. At 17:05 Flight 101 reported to be at 5.4 nautical miles from the Serena VOR. The controller cleared the flight to land on runway 30.
Instead of flying a base leg, the pilot flying made a diagonal approach to runway 30. During final approach, the aircraft was never aligned with the (extended) centreline of the runway.
Over the runway the airplane banked right. The right hand wing tip contacted the runway. The pilot aborted the landing and executed a go around. It appeared that the right hand wing tip was deflected upwards and had sustained substantial damage. There was also some damage to a flap fairing.

The sixteen occupants of the plane were not injured.
Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa and Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. were on board the private jet that departed following the visit of Pope Francis to Tacloban. Due to the approaching Tropical Storm Amang (Mekkhala) the Papal visit was cut short and all aircraft were prepared for departure.

Bud Day Field (SUX), Iowa. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The pilot, copilot, and two passengers were uninjured.

The pilot filed an instrument-flight-rules (IFR) flight plan with the destination and alternate airports, both of which were below weather minimums. The pilot and copilot departed from Des Moines Airport in weather minimums that were below the approach minimums for the departure airport. While en route, the destination airport's automated observing system continued to report weather below approach minimums, but the flight crew continued the flight. The flight crew then requested and were cleared for the instrument landing system (ILS) 31 approach and while on that approach were issued visibilities of 1,800 feet runway visual range after changing to tower frequency. During landing, the copilot told the pilot that he was not lined up with the runway. The pilot reportedly said, ""those are edge lights,"" and then realized that he was not properly lined up with the runway. The airplane then touched down beyond a normal touchdown point, about 2,800 feet down the runway, and off the left side of the runway surface. The airplane veered to the left, collapsing the nose landing gear. 

The company's procedures did not allow flight crew to depart to an airport that was below minimums but did allow for the flight crew, at their discretion, to perform a ""look-see"" approach to approach minimums if the weather was below minimums. The allowance of a ""look see"" approach essentially negates the procedural risk mitigation afforded by requiring approaches to be conducted only when weather was above approach minimums.";07:15;Beechcraft B200 Super King Air;Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa (BCBS);Tuesday 19 January 2010

All 65 passengers and 6 crew members were killed.
The aircraft took off from runway 14R at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport at 14:21 hours local time (11:21 UTC). Weather about the time of departure at Domodedovo Airport included limited visibility (2100m) during light snowfall. Temperature was -5°C, overcast cloud deck at 2600 feet AGL.
The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that, prior to departure, the heating of the three pitot tubes had not been turned on. 
After takeoff, at an altitude of 130-150 m (425-490 ft) above ground level, the autopilot was switched on. Flaps were raised as the aircraft climbed through an altitude of 550 m (1800 feet).
About 2 minutes 30 seconds after the takeoff, at an altitude of about 1300 meters (4265 feet) and an instrument speed of 465-470 km/h, there were discrepancies between the air speed readings on the captain's side compared to the standby airspeed indicator. The airspeed on the copilot's side is unknown as this parameter was not registered by the flight data recorder. There were no significant difference in the altitude indications. After another 25 seconds, the discrepancies reached about 30 km/h with the speed on the captain's side being greater.
After about 50 seconds, at an altitude of about 2000 meters (6560 ft), the airspeed on the standby airspeed indicator was higher and continued to increase while the airspeed on the captains ASI continued to decrease.
The flight crew then disconnected the autopilot. The airspeed on the captain's side continued to decrease, while the standby ASI showed 540-560 km/h. About 50 seconds after the autopilot was turned off, the flight passed an altitude of 1700-1900 m (5580-6230 ft) with vertical loads ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 g. Subsequently the aircraft entered a steep descent with the ASI on the captain's side showing 0 km/h, and the standby ASI showing 200 km/h. The pitch angle decreased to -30/-35 degrees with a vertical load factor of  0 g.
The aircraft impacted a snowy field around 14:27:05 and disintegrated. Before the collision with the ground, the standby ASI had increased to 800 km/h with the captain's ASI still displaying 0 km/h.

The airplane departed Rapid City Regional Airport, SD (RAP) about 20:08 local time (03:08 UTC) and was destined for ELK. Night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. 
The airplane was on an instrument approach to runway 17 at Elk City Airport about 23:00 local time (05:00 UTC) when it impacted a 29-foot tall electric utility pole about 10 feet 7 inches above ground level, located two miles north of the runway. The impact scattered debris from the separated pole for about 200 feet and resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and horizontal stabilizer. The pilot executed a go-around and diverted to Oklahoma City-Will Rogers Airport, OK (OKC), where it landed without incident about 23:40 local time (05:40 UTC).
The pilot reported that he thought he had leveled the airplane at an indicated altitude 2,500 feet msl and at no time during the descent and approach did the airplane's radar altimeter sound an alert indicating that he was below 400 feet agl radar altitude. He also reported that he never saw the terrain, never saw any obstructions, and he never saw the runway lights or airport environment. 
An examination of the airplane after landing at OKC showed substantial damage to the nose structure, lower and upper fuselage, and the left side of the horizontal stabilizer.

There were no injuries among the 24 passengers and three crew members.
Cirrus Airlines Flight 1567 departed Berlin-Tempelhof Airport (THF) at 16:30 on a domestic service to Mannheim Airport (MHG). The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF).
During the flight the copilot commented that he had difficulties in landing at Mannheim. The captain replied that he did fine.
At 17:36 the flight was cleared for a LOC/DME approach to runway 27. One minute later the flight reached the prescribed altitude of 5000 feet. The descent was continued until the PF noticed his error. The captain instructed the PF to arrest the descent and climb back towards 5000 feet. By then the flight had descended to 3800 feet, 100 feet below the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA).
After reaching the Final Approach Fix at 5000 feet, the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. Langen Radar instructed the flight to contact Mannheim Tower. 
The airplane was configured for the final approach and landing, with the captain telling the PF not to worry several times. The PF attempted to flare the airplane for landing, but the aircraft floated over the runway without touching down. The PF then stated: ""Oh - your control"". The captain took over control and replied ""My control"". At that moment the airplane was 200 m past the runway threshold. Touchdown was accomplished at 530 m, with 480 m of runway remaining.
The airplane failed to decelerate as expected and the captain called for manual braking action. The airplane overran the runway end at a speed of 50 knots. The left hand main gear collapsed as it hit a pothole. The aircraft then slid into an earthen wall and came to rest. There was no fire.

The pilot suffered a minor injury, but none of the 17 skydivers on board were injured.
The pilot reported that following takeoff from runway 26, he made a right turn and continued his climb for the skydive drop, however, while passing through 1,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost power. The pilot initiated a turn toward the airport, however, realized he was unable to make it, and landed in an open field. During the landing roll, the airplane exited the field, crossed E Jahant Road, impacted a truck, continued into a vineyard, and nosed over.

Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the fuel pressure line that connects the fuel control unit to the airframe fuel pressure transducer was fractured below the fuel control unit fitting's swaged seat. In addition, a supporting clamp for the fuel pressure fuel line was fractured and separated.

Both pilots were killed.
The aircraft departed Oslo-Gardermoen Airport, Norway at 23:10 hours local time on a mail and package flight to Tromsø, Norway. 
The take-off, departure and climb to cruising altitude, flight level 330, were performed according to normal procedures. The flight was uneventful until one minute and 20 seconds before the impact. The event started at 00:19:20 hrs, one hour and ten minutes into the flight in night time conditions of darkness without moonlight, clouds or turbulence. The lack of external visual references meant that the pilots were totally dependent on their instruments which consisted of three independent attitude indicators.
Suddenly a very fast increase in pitch was displayed on the left attitude indicator. The pilot in command, who was the pilot flying and seated in the left seat exclaimed a strong expression. The displayed pitch change meant that the pilot in command was subjected to a surprise effect and a degradation of spatial orientation. The autopilot was, most probably, disconnected automatically, a ""cavalry charge"" aural warning and a single chime was heard, the latter most likely as a result of miscompare between the left and right pilots' flying displays (PFD).
Both elevators moved towards nose down and nose down stabilizer trim was gradually activated from the left control wheel trim switch. The aeroplane started to descend, the angle of attack and G-loads became negative up to -1 G. Both pilots exclaimed strong expressions and the co-pilot said ""come up"".
About 13 seconds after the start of the event the crew were presented with two contradictory attitude indicators with red chevrons pointing in opposite directions. At the same time none of the instruments displayed any comparator caution due to the PFDs declutter function in unusual attitude.
Bank angle warnings were heard and the maximum operating speed and Mach number were exceeded 17 seconds after the start of the event, which activated the overspeed warning.
The speed continued to increase, a distress call was transmitted and acknowledged by the air traffic control and the engine thrust was reduced to flight idle.
The crew was active during the entire event. The dialogue between the pilots consisted mainly of different perceptions regarding turn directions. They also expressed the need to climb. At this stage, the pilots were probably subjected to spatial disorientation. The aircraft collided with the ground one minute and twenty seconds after the initial height loss.

Investigation revealed that the erroneous attitude indication on PFD 1 was caused by a malfunction of the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU 1). The pitch and roll comparator indications of the PFDs were removed when the attitude indicators displayed unusual attitudes. In the simulator, in which the crew had trained, the corresponding indications were not removed. During the event the pilots initially became communicatively isolated from each other.";00:20;Canadair CL-600-2B19 Regional Jet CRJ-200PF;West Air Sweden;Friday 8 January 2016

The aircraft was vectored for ILS approach to land on runway 24. At 1000 ft Radio Altitude the aircraft was stabilized and configured for landing with winds at 140 degrees/9 knots and moderate rain over the field. The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 24 with caution on a wet runway and deteriorating visibility. Before reaching 90 feet RA the wind was calm.
From 80 feet RA to 35 feet RA, the wind was already at left cross to tail-cross (left rear quadrant) and at variable direction from 160 degrees - 060 degrees momentary at 013 degrees with wind speed variably increasing from 1 knot to 6 knots. At 70 feet RA, the auto pilot was disengaged and the aircraft was manually flown by the captain until touchdown.
From 35 feet RA until before touchdown the wind shifted direction within the left rear quadrant and this time coming from 060 degrees to 112 degrees at increasing speed from 05 knots to 12 knots. Two seconds before touchdown the aircraft's true heading, which was initially at 240 degrees, changed to 230 degrees with groundspeed decreasing to 119 knots, drift angle increasing from +1 degree until +9 degrees just before touchdown. The left cross-tail wind from 122 degrees to 112 degrees showed an increasing wind speed from 16 knots to 22 knots.

After landing, the pilot taxied to apron number four in the southeastern corner of the aerodrome and unloaded the cargo from Sweden. After having done that he left the airport and went to a suite the company reserves for the crew to rest before the return leg to Sweden, which was planned for the following afternoon. As per standard policy, the company operates the aircraft with a two person crew. On the day in question the co-pilot had taken ill and the pilot had flown alone. The return leg to Sweden was also planned as a one-person crew flight. The following morning the aircraft was refuelled with 420 l of Jet A-1, in accordance with the pilot’s instructions. All in all ca. 725 kg of fuel was reserved for the return leg. It had been snowing at the airport until 11:20 and the temperature was hovering at around zero degrees Celsius. After having arrived at the airport at 16:30, the pilot began to brush the accumulated snow and frozen snow melt off the upper surfaces of the aircraft. As per his account, there was a great deal of snow and ice on the aircraft. He did not, however, manage to brush all of the impurities off of the surfaces of the aircraft. The cargo going to Sweden did not arrive in time for him to fly it to Skavsta, his primary destination. Therefore, he phoned in a change to the flight plan choosing Örebro instead as his destination. 
At 18:52:45 the pilot acknowledged on Helsinki Control Tower (TWR) that he was taxiing to takeoff position runway 22L at intersection Y. At 16:54:40 TWR gave him takeoff clearance from that intersection and gave him the wind direction. The pilot later said that he executed a normal takeoff, using 10 degrees of flaps.

The pilot and passenger sustained fatal injuries and the airplane was destroyed. 
USA Healthcare-Leasing had recently purchased the airplane. It had been purchased for the purpose of entering in into service as an executive/corporate airplane. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an IFR flight plan was filed. However, the pilot filed an IFR flight plan using a reserved registration number N66FB, and type of aircraft as a BE-200. The purpose of the flight was to reposition the newly purchased airplane to Folsom Field for the new owner, USA Healthcare. The airplane departed Greenville Downtown Airport, SC (GMU).

The airplane descended to 2,600 feet to the NDB, and initiated the approach upon crossing the NDB. As the airplane descended below 1,500 feet MSL, Huntsville lost radar contact. The next communication with the airplane was when the pilot radioed that he was initiating the missed approach. The published missed approach procedure is, 'Climbing lift turn to 2,700 direct CPP NDB and hold.' The airplane made a series of turns within the next one minute and 24 seconds. Additionally, the airplane's altitude varied but it never climbed above the altitude of 1,700 feet. The airplane wreckage was located approximately 3.5 miles north of the airport on a 345 degree heading on the opposite side of the outbound course to the NDB.

The airplane operated on a flight from Grenchen Airport. Destination of the ferry flight was Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY) in England.
The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) and the commander was pilot not flying (PNF).
HB-VOV left stand ""white alpha"" at 08:48 LT. The crew had previously received the necessary clearance to take off from runway 07 after a request to Grenchen aerodrome control (tower). The de-icing system was switched on from the outset in view of the prevailing conditions. The taxi checklist was completed on the short route to the runway 07 holding position via taxiway WHISKEY. This included, among other things, testing the functionality of the brakes, which was carried out by both crew members. No anomalies were found.
At approximately the same time, the Grenchen aerodrome control air traffic control officer (ATCO) arranged for a runway inspection, as visibility did not allow a view from the tower to the end of runway 07. 
After receiving clearance at 08:51 LT, the commander steered the aircraft onto runway 07 and initially turned west, in order to have the maximum runway length available for the subsequent takeoff (backtrack). After a further 180 degree clockwise turn, HB-VOV was positioned just north of the runway centerline, pointing to the east. To take advantage of the available runway length, the commander, according to his own statements, did not manoeuvre the aircraft precisely onto the runway centerline. Runway 07 has a takeoff run available (TORA) of 3281 ft (1000 m).
The ATCO observed HB-VOV taxiing onto the runway and instructed the crew to hold on the runway, as a runway inspection was still in progress. In view of the expected delay, the commander then set the parking brake.
At 08:53:43 LT, the crew of HB-VOV received takeoff clearance: ""Hotel Oscar Victor, wind zero six zero degrees six knots, runway zero seven, cleared for takeoff"".
The commander then switched on the pitot heater and landing lights, pushed the thrust levers forward and handed control over to the copilot. He instructed the copilot, in view of the reduced visibility, to carry out a so-called standing takeoff.
At a power setting with a low-pressure compressor speed N1 of approximately 90% of the rated speed the copilot took his feet off the brake pedals, set takeoff thrust and steered the aircraft on the runway centerline. The set takeoff thrust was checked by both crew members.
The ATCO watched the HB-VOV takeoff roll and noticed slower acceleration than usual. 
After checking the takeoff thrust and the speed indications at the beginning of the takeoff roll, the commander had the impression that the aircraft's acceleration was lower than usual. HB-VOV attained a speed of 80 kt before taxiway ECHO 1, i.e. rather late, but still within a framework which seemed acceptable to the commander. On reaching rotation speed (VR), in the co-pilot's estimation approximately 250 m before the end of the runway, the commander called out ""rotate"", whereupon the copilot pulled on the control column. Both crew members immediately noticed that the nose of the aircraft was not lifting. After a repeated callout by the commander, he too pulled on the control column. On overshooting the end of the runway, the right main landing gear of HB-VOV struck a ""end-of-runway"" light, which was perceived by the crew as a distinctly noticeable impact. On the transition from the runway to the grass, the copilot, according to his statement, had the feeling that it was no longer possible to continue the takeoff and briefly reduced power. But at approximately the same time, the copilot noted that HB-VOV had already lifted off and applied full power again.
At the same time, he asked the commander whether the takeoff process should continue. The latter answered the copilot's question in the affirmative, with the consideration that they would perhaps still have a chance to get the aircraft into the air. The events from overshooting the end of the runway to lift-off of HB-VOV, after a roll of more than 100 metres in the adjacent meadow, occurred within a few seconds. In the process the aircraft crossed a small stream bed running perpendicular to the runway.
Once the aircraft had attained the normal attitude for a climb at the appropriate takeoff safety speed V2, the commander reduced power to maximum continuous thrust (MCT) and retracted the flaps. Then the crew realised that the parking brake was still set. The commander retracted the landing gear and detected that the red warning light did not go out. He instructed the copilot to keep the speed low and extended the gear again. All three landing gear indicators indicated green. At an altitude of approximately 3500 ft AMSL, HB-VOV was transferred to Berne arrival air traffic control. As part of the climb check, the de-icing system was switched off again.
The crew subsequently decided to make an alternate landing at Zurich airport.
The crew did not declare an emergency and did not apply for landing priority. According to the landing gear indicators in the cockpit, the crew assumed that the landing gear was extended and locked. For this reason they did not make a low pass at Zurich airport for an external visual check of the landing gear.
After the approach and landing, HB-VOV exited runway 14 at the end via taxiway HOTEL 3. The crew then waived a visual check and taxied the aircraft directly to the stand on the apron near the General Aviation Centre (GAC).
As a result of the collision of the right main landing gear of HB-VOV with the endof-runway light and the subsequent crossing of the stream bed, structural damage was found in the area of the nose gear and main gear, as well as to both rear wing spars. Also, a certain asymmetry was ascertained in the dimensions of the aircraft.
The two pilots were uninjured in the accident.";08:53;Cessna 525 CitationJet CJ1+;Swiss Private Aviation;Wednesday 16 February 2011

CV-580As had been converted to aerial tankers (water bombers) for fighting forest fires. The accident flight was a training flight that consisted of stop-and-go circuits at the La Ronge Airport (YVC). The purpose of the training was to instruct and cross-qualify new CV-580A captains as first officers for future training requirements. The first two circuits were unremarkable; all altitudes, speeds, and aircraft performance were as expected for the exercises being carried out.
The final approach leg of the third circuit differed from the first two in that the aircraft's speed was lower. The airspeed was stabilized at 103 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). The rate of descent and respective altitudes were unstable compared with those of the first two circuits. The captain had called for a power setting of 150 to 200 hp on both engines on short final approach, and the flaps, which had been set at 24°, were selected to 28°. The aircraft entered a high sink rate of approximately 1280 feet per minute.
In an effort to arrest the high sink rate, the captain, who was the pilot flying, called for increased power, briefly increased pitch attitude, and then touched down on the runway, approximately 200 feet beyond the threshold. The first officer, the pilot not flying, responded to the captain's call for power by rapidly advancing both power levers to a point beyond the maximum power setting limit. When the power levers were advanced, the left propeller immediately autofeathered and the left engine shut down. The captain, noting the position of the power levers, quickly retarded them to a position he assumed would give maximum power.
During the final approach leg and on the go-around, the captain was not continuously setting or monitoring the engine power settings and consequently was unaware of the engine power or the nature of the emergency. The elapsed time between encountering the high sink rate and initiating the go-around was approximately seven seconds.
After touching down on the runway, the captain, believing that the aircraft was not aligned with the runway, initiated a go-around. The autofeather was not called out or identified as an emergency. The decision to go around was not called out or communicated to the first officer. The go-around was commenced at an airspeed of approximately 94 KIAS (V1 minus 2)1. The gear was then selected up during a momentary positive rate of climb and the flaps were retracted at an airspeed of 95 KIAS, after the aircraft cleared the VOR radio range transmitter located left of the departure end of runway 36.
Shortly after the aircraft became airborne, its left wing dropped slightly and could not be righted. The airspeed fluctuated between 93 and 98 KIAS and would not increase with a positive pitch angle. Once the flaps were retracted at 95 KIAS, the angle of bank increased uncontrollably. The aircraft started to descend, and collided with trees and terrain in a wooded area on the airport property.";12:32;Convair CV-580;Saskatchewan Government Northern Air Operations;Sunday 14 May 2006

Both pilots were not injured.
ZK-RCA took off from Gisborne for a planned one-hour crew-training flight. A check and training captain (the captain) and a pilot undergoing command training, who was the pilot flying, were on board the aircraft.
The flight included emergency procedure exercises with simulated engine failures, circuits and landings using runway 14. The first circuit was normal using both engines. The second circuit was flown with the left engine power lever retarded to simulate a left engine failure shortly after takeoff. On short final approach a single-engine go-around was commenced from the decision height and the aircraft recircuited with the left engine simulated as inoperative.
The third circuit was flown at an altitude lower than normal. A moderate wind from the south-west created a right crosswind for the landing. The pilots said the approach was normal until about a height of 50 feet before landing when the aircraft descent rate increased. They said the landing was somewhat firmer than normal and firmer than they expected. Although the
aircraft landed straight it began to veer to the left and the pilot under training was unable to maintain directional control. The captain ordered a go-around.
the left undercarriage HAD collapsed rearwards to about 40 degrees past its normal down position.
When the aircraft became airborne the crew selected the undercarriage up but the left undercarriage red in-transit indicator light remained on. After the aircraft climbed to 1500 feet above mean sea level the captain reselected the undercarriage down. The nose and right undercarriage position indicator lights displayed normal green (down) indications but the left
undercarriage red in-transit indicator light remained on.
After the aircraft became airborne the aerodrome controller told the crew that the left undercarriage was not down correctly but was hanging at about 45 degrees. The crew, unsure whether the undercarriage was inclined forward or trailing, loaded the aircraft with positive “g” (vertical acceleration) in an attempt to force the undercarriage into the down locked position.
The red indicator light remained on. The pilot under training then flew the aircraft at low level past the control tower and the controller confirmed the undercarriage was trailing at about 45 degrees aft of its normal down position.
The pilot under training flew the aircraft to the east and to a higher altitude where the crew considered their options. The captain spoke to the company’s Gisborne base manager and company personnel at Hamilton, advising them of the situation. The captain elected to fly ZK-RCA to Hamilton Aerodrome where the company’s headquarters and engineering base were located. Hamilton Aerodrome was an international aerodrome with a higher category of emergency services and a longer runway than Gisborne Aerodrome.
The flight to Hamilton was flown with the undercarriage selected up but at a speed below the undercarriage extended speed limitation of 173 knots. The captain spoke with the operator’s engineering personnel and the Metro fleet captain. Following the fleet captain’s advice the crew swapped seats to occupy their more familiar positions, with the captain in the left seat and the pilot under training in the right seat. The captain completed 2 low approaches and overshoots at Hamilton Aerodrome for engineering and flying personnel to view the undercarriage in the down selected and up selected positions. This was carried out to analyse the possible failure and to assist the captain to decide what action he should take.
In the retracted position the left undercarriage wheels protruded below the engine nacelle some 45 degrees below the normal horizontal up position. The captain decided to land the aircraft with the undercarriage selected up, in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. He orbited over the aerodrome burning off fuel to the minimum, leaving about 10 minutes of fuel to complete a landing, or carry out a go-around for a second approach if necessary.
In the meantime the emergency rescue services and the operator put together a plan to attend the aircraft as it landed and to recover it from the runway. The crash fire service sprayed fire retardant foam along the runway to reduce the potential for fire.
The captain flew a stabilised approach to runway 18. On short final some 50 feet before touchdown he directed the second pilot to pull both the red engine stop and feather knobs. This action cut the fuel supply to both engines and feathered the propellers. The second pilot also closed the fuel shut-off valves and hydraulic shut-off valves. The captain selected the batteries off.
ZK-RCA touched down straight and slid some distance before it slewed to the right side of the runway and onto the grass where it turned through about 170 degrees and came to rest. About 1700 m of runway were used during the landing. The pilots evacuated the aircraft immediately through the emergency exit over the right wing, having already informed the emergency
services of their plan.
Once the pilots cleared the aircraft the emergency fire service sprayed fire retardant under the aircraft around likely hot spots. This action had been predetermined and was taken to eliminate the potential for fire to erupt in the event any fuel lines or fuel tanks had ruptured. The fire retardant was biodegradable and non-corrosive. No fire occurred.";14:00;Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III;null;Thursday 15 June 2000

A pronounced dip in the runway surface initially prevented the pilots from seeing the runway end. When it became apparent to the commander that it would not be possible to stop before the end of the
runway, he deliberately did not select alternate braking, as this would have caused loss of nosewheel steering, but instead used nosewheel steering to turn the aircraft sharply to the right.

It was a regular public transport flight that had been planned to refuel at Sasereme and continue to Balimo and on to Daru. For the flight to Sasereme, the pilot in command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot, and the copilot was the handling pilot. The aircraft arrived over the Saserema airstrip at 02:40. While en-route, the crew was informed by the company flight operations staff that it had been raining at Sasereme throughout the previous night until morning, but the prevailing weather was fine.
The flight was being conducted under the visual flight rules (VFR) procedures. The copilot had not flown into Sasereme before, so this was a training flight for her. During the cruise before top of descent, the crew discussed the approach and landing requirements. Because of the wet, slippery and rough airstrip surface conditions and a landing weight of 5,300 kg, they agreed on a 30 degrees flap settings and a approach speed of 73 knots.
The weather, as observed by the crew, was sunny and fine with few clouds around and the wind was estimated to be light and variable (2 to 3 kt) even though there was no wind sock available to indicate the actual wind velocity. The crew opted to land on strip 14 and joined the circuit on left downwind.
Passing through 50 ft the copilot flared the aircraft and it floated in ground effect. As the main landing gear touched down on the centreline of the strip it skipped, became airborne and stayed in ground effect for at least another 20 m. On the second touchdown the aircraft yawed to the left and at that point the PIC took over the controls and applied full reverse thrust. He applied right rudder to regain the centreline, but at the same time the left main landing gear started impacting the ruts in the surface of the strip, severely degrading directional control.
The PIC subsequently reported that at that point he felt it was not safe to apply power for an aborted landing. He moved the left power lever out of reverse while keeping full reverse and right rudder input on the right engine and began pulsing the brakes. The left main wheel continued impacting more ruts as the aircraft decelerated. Eventually the left main wheel hit a deep rut pulling the aircraft sharply to the left off the runway.
That partially dislodged the landing gear from the airframe causing the left wing to impact the ground. The aircraft came to rest about 5 m from the edge of the airstrip. The PIC shut down the engines while the copilot assisted the passengers from aircraft through the right rear cabin door.";02:40 UTC;de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300;Airlines PNG;Tuesday 15 May 2012

It was a dark night with the moon still below the horizon. The crew was established on the localizer at about 10 nm from the runway threshold and had the runway in sight.
At 19:23, at a height of approximately 1500 ft, the undercarriage was deployed at an indicated airspeed (IAS) 157 kt. 
At a height of about 1000 ft, the crew disengaged the autopilot. The aircraft was stabilized at a slightly higher speed than Vapp, on the glide path and with a vertical speed of -700 ft/min. At a height of approximately 200 ft, the pilot flying disconnected the auto-throttle.
The approach remained stabilized on the 3° glide path at a speed equal to Vapp + 3 kt and a descent rate of 700 ft/min until a height of 100 ft. Passing 100 ft, the IAS started to decrease and went below Vapp. The rate of descent increased to 850 ft/min.
The pitch was 4° and the nose started to lift slightly. At a height of 30 ft, the plane passed slightly below the glide slope at an IAS of Vapp -4 kt.

The airplane was on jacks, for a tire change, when a mechanic needed access to the airplane's Maintenance Data Acquisition Unit (MDAU) to check out the problem that the airplane was having regarding false over speed warnings. Since the airplane was on jacks the mechanic had to disable the weight-on-wheel (WOW) switches in order to simulate that the WOW was in the ground mode, not in the air mode, and to gain access to the MDAU. The mechanic said he used a ""Popsicle stick"" to disable these switches. After the maintenance was completed the sticks were not removed, and the inspector that returned the airplane to service was not aware that the WOW switches had been disabled for any reason and no notation was mentioned in the work logs.

There was no injury to the crew or the 15 passengers.
The flight, operated by Eagle Airways, departed Timaru Airport (TIU) at 07:10 on a domestic service to Wellington International Airport (WLG). After takeoff the aircraft was climbed to a cruising altitude of 21000 feet and the flight progressed uneventfully north towards Wellington.
At 08:12 ZK-EAK was approaching the commencement of the ILS approach and the crew started to configure the aircraft for the approach and landing. Initial flap was extended and approaching the glide path the first officer moved the landing gear lever to lower the gear, but the undercarriage failed to extend.
The first officer returned the gear lever to the up position and at 08:15 he advised air traffic control (ATC) that they had a landing gear problem and were initiating the missed approach procedure. The aircraft was climbed to above the cloud and levelled at 6000 feet. ATC gave radar vectors to take ZK-EAK initially to the west of Wellington.
The landing gear lever was selected down a second time and again there was no indication of any gear movement. The crew checked electrical switches and panels, and found nothing that would stop the gear lowering. The crew decided that before completing further fault analysis, the aircraft should be positioned in an area away from cloud and other traffic. Knowing the area around Woodbourne was clear of cloud, the first officer got ATC clearance to descend in that direction. The captain told the passengers what had happened and of their intention to divert to the Woodbourne area to hold.
The aircraft was established in a holding pattern clear of Woodbourne Aerodrome and the crew carried out the quick reference handbook (QRH) actions for manual extension of the landing gear. Control of the aircraft was passed to the first officer to allow the captain to operate the manual pump to lower the landing gear. The captain reported that as he operated the pump handle he felt no resistance or pressure that would normally be expected. After pumping the handle for some time without success, he lowered and secured the handle and assumed control of the aircraft again.
The first officer contacted the operator’s maintenance facility at Woodbourne and briefed the staff on the situation. He also advised the Woodbourne aerodrome controller. The controller replied that a full emergency response had been activated. 
The crew reviewed the QRH and repeated the actions for manual gear lowering, but the landing gear remained retracted. The operator’s maintenance staff contacted the crew and offered several suggestions on possible causes and actions that might assist, including isolating electrical power to the landing gear motor, but the landing gear remained in the up position.
The crew, having exhausted all possible options to lower the landing gear and aware of the amount of fuel remaining, prepared the aircraft for a wheels-up landing at Woodbourne. The first officer left his seat and individually briefed the passengers for the landing, including what they were required to do and when and how to exit the aircraft after landing. The first officer then checked passenger security and stowed all of the cabin bags in the front row of seats before returning to his seat.
The crew reviewed the QRH actions for a wheels-up landing, and after excess fuel had been used, turned off all non-essential electrical items, including pulling the landing gear control circuit breakers to prevent uncommanded movement of the landing gear. The crew set the flap to 17º and positioned the aircraft for a landing on runway 24. At about 09:02 the aerodrome controller confirmed emergency services were in place and cleared the aircraft to land.
At about 500 feet, as ZK-EAK was turned to final approach, the first officer instructed the passengers to brace for the landing. At 09:07, ZK-EAK touched down.

The APU air intake is located on the right of the fuselage, on the transition from the fin to the fuselage. De-icing fluid can easily enter through the open air intake when the APU is in operation. Furthermore, the de-icing agent causes a strong fog when applied, due to the difference in temperature. This restricts the visibility of the air intake. In addition, the area around the air inlet of the APU is not marked, making it harder to notice the location of the intake.

Before pushback from the gate, the first officer, who was the pilot monitoring, initialized the flight management computer (FMC) and mistakenly entered the incorrect departure runway (27R instead of the assigned 27L). As the captain taxied onto runway 27L for departure, he noticed that the wrong runway was entered in the FMC. The captain asked the first officer to correct the runway entry in the FMC, which she completed about 27 seconds before the beginning of the takeoff roll; however, she did not enter the FLEX temperature (a reduced takeoff thrust setting) for the newly entered runway or upload the related V-speeds. As a result, the FMC's ability to execute a FLEX power takeoff was invalidated, and V-speeds did not appear on the primary flight display (PFD) or the multipurpose control display unit during the takeoff roll. 
Once the airplane was cleared for takeoff on runway 27L, the captain set FLEX thrust with the thrust levers, and he felt that the performance and acceleration of the airplane on the takeoff roll was normal. About 2 seconds later, as the airplane reached about 56 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the flight crew received a single level two caution chime and an electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) message indicating that the thrust was not set correctly. The first officer called ""engine thrust levers not set."" According to the operator's pilot handbook, in response to an ""engine thrust levers not set"" ECAM message, the thrust levers should be moved to the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) detent.

However, the captain responded by saying ""they're set"" and moving the thrust levers from the FLEX position to the CL (climb) detent then back to the FLEX position. As the airplane continued to accelerate, the first officer did not make a callout at 80 KIAS, as required. As the airplane reached 86 KIAS, the automated RETARD aural alert sounded and continued until the end of the CVR recording. According to Airbus, the RETARD alert is designed to occur at 20 ft radio altitude on landing and advise the pilot to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The captain later reported that he had never heard an aural RETARD alert on takeoff, only knew of it on landing, and did not know what it was telling him. He further said that when the RETARD aural alert sounded, he did not plan to reject the takeoff because they were in a high-speed regime, they had no red warning lights, and there was nothing to suggest that the takeoff should be rejected. 

The first officer later reported that there were no V-speeds depicted on the PFD and, thus, she could not call V1 or VR during the takeoff. She was not aware of any guidance or procedure that recommended rejecting or continuing a takeoff when there were no V-speeds displayed. The captain stated that he had recalled the V-speeds as previously briefed from the Taxi checklist, which happened to be the same V-speeds for runway 27L. The captain continued the takeoff roll despite the lack of displayed V-speeds, no callouts from the first officer, and the continued and repeated RETARD aural alert. 
The airplane rotated at 164 KIAS. The captain had ""the perception the aircraft was unsafe to fly"" and that he decided ""the safest action was not to continue,"" so he commenced a rejected takeoff. FDR data indicate that the captain reduced the engines to idle and made an airplane-nose-down input as the airplane reached 167 KIAS (well above the V1 speed of 157 KIAS) and achieved a 6.7 degree nose-high attitude. The airplane's pitch decreased until the nosegear contacted the runway. However, the airplane then bounced back into the air and achieved a radio altitude of about 15 ft. The tail of the airplane then struck the runway surface, followed by the main landing gear then the nose landing gear, resulting in its fracture. The airplane slid to its final resting position on the left side of runway 27L.

The operator's SOPs address the conditions under which a rejected takeoff should be performed within both low-speed (below 80 KIAS) and high-speed (between 80 KIAS and V1) regimes but provide no guidance for rejecting a takeoff after V1 and rotation. Simulator testing performed after the accident demonstrated that increasing the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent, as required by SOPs upon the activation of the ""thrust not set"" ECAM message, would have silenced the RETARD aural alert. 
At the time of the accident, neither the operator's training program nor manuals provided to flight crews specifically addressed what to do in the event the RETARD alert occurred during takeoff; although, 9 months before the accident, US Airways published a safety article regarding the conditions under which the alert would activate during takeoff. The operator's postaccident actions include a policy change (published via bulletin) to its pilot handbook specifying that moving the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent will cancel the RETARD aural alert.";18:30;Airbus A320-214;US Airways;Thursday 13 March 2014

The pilot reported that 10 minutes into the flight, he received an instrument flight rules flight plan from air traffic control (ATC). The cloud tops were at 8,500 feet and he was cleared to 6,000 ft, which put him in the clouds.
Within minutes of entering the clouds, the airplane lost all electrical power, and the pilot lost contact with ATC. He climbed back out of the clouds and proceeded to the west; he found a hole in the clouds over the Pacific Ocean, descended, and turned southbound. He said partial electrical power was restored, and he tried to advise ATC of his problems. His transmissions were not understood, but he flew to Carlsbad, and received a green light from the tower personnel.
He extended the landing gear and flaps but had no airspeed indicator. When the airplane touched down, the pilot realized that his landing gear had not extended. Witnesses reported that the airplane approached the runway and was faster than a normal landing, and the gear was still retracted.
The pilot reported that after the loss of electrical power he did not perform any emergency procedures as the checklist was in a cabinet and not reachable; he was just trying to fly the airplane. The pilot stated that when he departed from Palm Springs, the generators were on. When asked if he attempted to reset the generators, he again stated that he did not do any emergency procedures except to fly the airplane. In a later interview, the pilot stated that he may have accidently turned on the starter switches, which would have turned off the generators and accounted for the loss of electrical power.
A mechanic was dispatched to help defuel the airplane about 30 minutes after the accident. He reported that fuel was leaking from the right wing so he disconnected the battery. He opened an access panel but was unable to mechanically turn off the fuel selector valve (FSV). He reconnected the battery and went into the cockpit. He saw that the landing gear handle was in the down position, and the flap handle was in the full up position. The battery switch was in the OFF position with the battery gang bar down, which turned off the battery, generator 1, and generator 2. After lifting up the gang bar and turning on the battery switch, he saw nothing on the cockpit displays but heard the airplane power up. He located the FSV, turned it off, and confirmed with a firefighter that the solenoid in the wing audibly closed. The mechanic turned the electrical power off and disconnected the battery. The fuel leak from the right engine filter bowl stopped.
It took the mechanic about 30 minutes to gather the equipment needed to defuel the airplane, and he decided to start with the right side by connecting to the engine supply line. He reconnected the battery and entered the cockpit to turn on the electrical power. With power on, the cockpit displays illuminated, and he heard the landing gear try to operate to the down position. After another mechanic pulled the circuit breaker for the avionics, he defueled the airplane.
During recovery, the airplane was lifted off the ground, and the landing gear were successfully extended to the down and locked position.";15:48;Beechcraft B200 King Air;N505SP LLC;Saturday 16 May 2015

The 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 98 of the 127 passengers were not injured; the other 29 passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged. 
Flight 1086 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Georgia, where it departed at 09:23 hours local time. 
Given the winter weather conditions at LaGuardia, the flight crew was concerned about the available landing distance on runway 13 (7003 ft / 2135 m). While en route to LGA they spent considerable time analyzing the airplane’s stopping performance.
The flight crew also requested braking action reports about 45 and 35 minutes before landing, but none were available at those times because of runway snow clearing operations. The unavailability of braking actions reports and the uncertainty about the runway’s condition created some situational stress for the captain, who was the pilot flying.
After runway 13 became available for arriving airplanes, the flight crews of two preceding airplanes (which landed on the runway about 16 and 8 minutes before the accident landing) reported good braking action on the runway, so the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runway’s surface after the airplane broke out of the clouds. However, the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow, which was inconsistent with their expectations based on the braking action reports and the snow clearing operations that had concluded less than 30 minutes before the airplane landed. The snowier-than-expected runway, along with the relatively short runway length and the presence of Flushing Bay directly off the departure end of the runway, most likely increased the captain’s concerns about his ability to stop the airplane within the available runway distance, which exacerbated his situational stress. 
The captain made a relatively aggressive reverse thrust input almost immediately after touchdown. Both pilots were aware that 1.3 EPR was the target setting for contaminated runways.
As reverse thrust EPR was rapidly increasing, the captain’s attention was focused on other aspects of the landing, which included steering the airplane to counteract a slide to the left and ensuring that the spoilers had deployed, which was a necessary action for the autobrakes to engage. The maximum EPR values reached during the landing were 2.07 on the left engine and 1.91 on the right engine, which were much higher than the target setting of 1.3 EPR. These high EPR values likely resulted from a combination of the captain’s stress; his relatively aggressive reverse thrust input; and operational distractions, including the airplane’s continued slide to the left despite the captain’s efforts to steer it away from the snowbanks alongside the runway. All of these factors reduced the captain’s monitoring of EPR indications. The high EPR values caused rudder blanking, which occurs on MD-80 series airplanes when smooth airflow over the rudder is disrupted by high reverse thrust, and a subsequent loss of aerodynamic directional control. Although the captain stowed the thrust reversers and applied substantial right rudder, right nosewheel steering, and right manual braking, the airplane’s departure from the left side of the runway could not be avoided because directional control was regained too late to be effective.
The airplane departed the left side of runway 13 about 3,000 feet from the approach end of the runway. The tracks were on a heading of about 10 degrees from the runway heading.
About 4,100 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplanes left wing initially struck the airport’s perimeter fence, which is located on top of the berm, and the airplane tracks turn back parallel with runway 13. About 5,000 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplane came to rest with its nose over the berm. The left wing of the airplane destroyed about 940 feet of the perimeter fence.";11:02;McDonnell Douglas MD-88;Delta Air Lines;Thursday 5 March 2015

The copilot was the handling pilot for the descent, approach and landing at Darwin and the pilot in command was the monitoring pilot. The crew had received a weather briefing prior to the departure from Cairns, informing them that there were showers and thunderstorms in the Darwin area for their arrival.
Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the crew to conduct the Darwin runway 29 ILS approach. The monitoring pilot stated that the runway was in sight prior to flying over the Howard Springs non-directional beacon (NDB).
Information from the aircraft’s flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the aircraft flew over the Howard Springs NDB at about 3,000 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), with a computed air speed of 221 knots.
The aircraft was configured for landing at the outer marker, where the handling pilot disconnected the autopilot and the approach was flown manually by reference to the ILS and visual reference with the runway lighting.
During the approach and landing, the aircraft autothrottle remained engaged.
At approximately 700 ft AMSL, the aircraft entered a rain shower. The monitoring pilot switched on the windscreen wipers and, as both pilots stated that they could see the runway lighting and PAPI, the approach was continued.
At approximately 30 ft radio altitude, the FDR recorded a rate of descent of approximately 1,000 ft/min at the same time as an abrupt control column nose up command was applied. The copilot recalled hearing the synthesised calls of radio altitude from the aircraft’s radar altimeter.
At 21:14:50, the aircraft touched down with a rate of descent of about 1,000 ft/min, which resulted in a hard impact with the runway prior to the 300 m runway markings. The aircraft then bounced before settling onto the runway. The crew completed the landing rollout and taxied the aircraft to the terminal.";21:15;Boeing 717-23S;null;Thursday 7 February 2008

The airplane carried 12 crew members an 216 passengers. Flight AF447 departed at 19:29 local time (May 31) from Rio de Janeiro (GIG). The takeoff weight was 232.8t (for a MTOW of 233 t), including 70.4 tonnes of fuel. The captain was PNF, one of the co-pilots was Pilot Flying (PF).
The flight progressed as planned with the crew contacting several air traffic control centres along the way. Cruising altitude was FL350.
At 23:35 local time (01:35 UTC), the crew informed the Atlantic Area Control Centre (CINDACTA III) controller that they had passed the INTOL waypoint. INTOL is an RNAV waypoint located in the Atlantic Ocean, 565 km from Natal, Brazil. 
At 01:48 UTC the aircraft went out of the radar coverage of CINDACTA III, Fernando de Noronha. The meteorological situation in the area of AF447's flight path over the Atlantic was typical of that encountered in the month of June in the inter-tropical convergence zone. There were powerful cumulonimbus clusters on the route of AF447. Some of them could have been the centre of some notable turbulence.
At 01:55, the captain woke the second co-pilot and said ""[...] he’s going to take my place"". The captain then attended the briefing between the two co-pilots, during which the Pilot Flying said, in particular ""the little bit of turbulence that you just saw [...] we should find the same ahead [...] we’re in the cloud layer unfortunately we can’t climb much for the moment because the temperature is falling more slowly than forecast"" and that ""the logon with Dakar failed"". The captain left the cockpit at 02:01:46 UTC.
The airplane was flying at FL350 and at Mach 0.82 and the pitch attitude was about 2.5 degrees. Autopilot 2 and auto-thrust were engaged. At 02:06:04, the PF called the cabin crew, telling them that ""in two minutes we should enter an area where it’ll move about a bit more than at the moment, you should watch out"" and he added ""I’ll call you back as soon as we’re out of it"".
At 02:08:07, the PNF said ""you can maybe go a little to the left [...]"". The airplane began a slight turn to the left, the change in relation to the initial route being about 12 degrees. The level of turbulence increased slightly and the crew decided to reduce the speed to about Mach 0.8.
From 02:10:05, the autopilot then auto-thrust disengaged and the PF said ""I have the controls"". The airplane began to roll to the right and the PF made a left nose-up input. The stall warning sounded twice in a row. The recorded parameters show a sharp fall from about 275 kt to 60 kt in the speed displayed on the left primary flight display (PFD), then a few moments later in the speed displayed on the integrated standby instrument system (ISIS). 
At 02:10:16, the PNF said ""so, we’ve lost the speeds"" then ""alternate law [...]"". 
The airplane’s pitch attitude increased progressively beyond 10 degrees and the plane started to climb. The PF made nose-down control inputs and alternately left and right roll inputs. The vertical speed, which had reached 7,000 ft/min, dropped to 700 ft/min and the roll varied between 12 degrees right and 10 degrees left. The speed displayed on the left side increased sharply to 215 kt (Mach 0.68). The airplane was then at an altitude of about 37,500 ft and the recorded angle of attack was around 4 degrees. From 02:10:50, the PNF tried several times to call the captain back. 
At 02:10:51, the stall warning was triggered again. The thrust levers were positioned in the TO/GA detent and the PF maintained nose-up inputs. The recorded angle of attack, of around 6 degrees at the triggering of the stall warning, continued to increase. The trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) passed from 3 to 13 degrees nose-up in about 1 minute and remained in the latter position until the end of the flight.
Around fifteen seconds later, the speed displayed on the ISIS increased sharply towards 185 kt; it was then consistent with the other recorded speed. The PF continued to make nose-up inputs. The airplane’s altitude reached its maximum of about 38,000 ft, its pitch attitude and angle of attack being 16 degrees.
At around 02:11:40, the captain re-entered the cockpit. During the following seconds, all of the recorded speeds became invalid and the stall warning stopped. The altitude was then about 35,000 ft, the angle of attack exceeded 40 degrees and the vertical speed was about -10,000 ft/min. The airplane’s pitch attitude did not exceed 15 degrees and the engines' N1's were close to 100%. The airplane was subject to roll oscillations that sometimes reached 40 degrees. The PF made an input on the sidestick to the left and nose-up stops, which lasted about 30 seconds.
At 02:12:02, the PF said ""I don’t have any more indications"", and the PNF said ""we have no valid indications"". At that moment, the thrust levers were in the IDLE detent and the engines' N1's were at 55%. Around fifteen seconds later, the PF made pitch-down inputs. In the following moments, the angle of attack decreased, the speeds became valid again and the stall warning sounded again.
At 02:13:32, the PF said ""we’re going to arrive at level one hundred"". About fifteen seconds later, simultaneous inputs by both pilots on the sidesticks were recorded and the PF said ""go ahead you have the controls"". 
The angle of attack, when it was valid, always remained above 35 degrees. The recordings stopped at 02:14:28. The last recorded values were a vertical speed of -10,912 ft/min, a ground speed of 107 kt, pitch attitude of 16.2 degrees nose-up, roll angle of 5.3 degrees left and a magnetic heading of 270 degrees. The airplane struck the surface of the sea.

Several attempts were made to locate the wreckage of the airplane. Finally on April 3, 2011, a search vessel using unmanned submarines located pieces of wreckage including an engine, landing gear and fuselage and wing parts on the Ocean floor.";00:14;Airbus A330-203;Air France;Monday 1 June 2009

The flight was parked at gate D3 at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International/Wold-Chamberlain Airport, Minnesota and was bound for the Philadelphia International Airport, Pennsylvania. No injuries were reported. The driver of the tug and a food service worker received minor injuries.
The aircraft was parked and was being prepared for departure by various ground workers including the tug driver and workers restocking the aircraft food supply. The driver of the tug said that he was moving the vehicle into position in order to connect the aircraft tow bar in preparation for pushback. He said that when he placed the tug into gear, it lurched forward into the parked aircraft. He said that pieces of the aircraft protruded through the windshield of the vehicle and pinned him into his seat. He said that he was unable to shift the vehicle into reverse and his leg was pinned on the accelerator pedal. Other ground workers in the area attempted to shut off the tug's engine. The driver said that the vehicle continued to drive forward until the engine was finally shut off. During the event, the pilot of the aircraft had applied the brakes when he noticed the unplanned movement of the airplane. The aircraft was pushed backward about 30 feet causing damage to the nose section of the fuselage. A food service worker was injured when he jumped from his vehicle which was parked next to the aircraft.

Subsequent to the accident, the tug was placed on jacks and a check performed. During the check it was found that the normal engine shutoff switch would not shut the engine off if the engine was operated at high throttle settings. It was further discovered that at high throttle settings, the brake system was not able to stop the rotation of the drive wheels. No anomalies were found during this test that would explain the lurching described by the tug driver. Subsequent to the testing, the throttle system of the tug was replaced as a precautionary measure by the airline.
During the course of the investigation, it was found that the tug had been involved in a previous incident where an aircraft was damaged. A report of the previous incident was obtained. The driver of the tug during the previous incident reported that the tug lurched when he was attempting to move the tug into position to connect to the aircraft.";14:37;McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31;Northwest Airlines;Tuesday 1 May 2001

At 08:32 hrs G-LGNL was cleared to enter runway 18 at Stornoway Airport and take off, and the ATC controller transmitted that the surface wind was from 270° at 27 kt. The commander commented to the co-pilot that the wind was across the runway and that there was no tailwind. As the aircraft taxied onto the runway, the co-pilot applied almost full right aileron input consistent with a cross-wind from the right, and the commander said to the co-pilot ""charlie , one hundred, strong wind from the right"". The commander advanced the power levers, the co-pilot said ""autocoarsen high"" and the engine torques increased symmetrically. The commander instructed the co-pilot to ""set takeoff power"" to which the co-pilot replied ""apr armed"". Approximately one second after this call, the engine torques began to increase symmetrically, reaching 100% as the aircraft accelerated through 70 kt.
During the early stages of the takeoff, left rudder was applied and the aircraft maintained an approximately constant heading. As the aircraft continued accelerating, the rudder was centralised, after which there was a small heading change to the left, then to the right, then a rapid heading change to the left causing the aircraft to deviate to the left of the runway centreline.
The pilot applied right rudder but although the aircraft changed heading to the right in response, it did not alter the aircraft’s track significantly and the aircraft skidded to the left, departing the runway surface onto the grass at an IAS of 80 kt. The power levers remained at full power as the aircraft crossed a disused runway and back onto grass. During this period the nose landing gear collapsed before the aircraft came to a halt approximately 38 m left of the edge of the runway and 250 m from where it first left the paved surface.
After the aircraft came to a halt, the captain saw that the propellers were still turning and so called into the cabin for the passengers to remain seated. One of the passengers shouted for someone to open the emergency exit but the cabin crew member instructed the passengers not to do so because the propellers were still turning. The co-pilot observed that the right propeller was still turning so operated the engine fire extinguishers to shut down both engines. When the passenger seated in the emergency exit row on the right of the aircraft saw that the right propeller had stopped, he decided to open the exit. He climbed out onto the wing and helped the remaining passengers leave the aircraft through the same exit, instructing them to slide off the rear of the wing onto the ground. The left propeller was still turning at the time the right over-wing exit was opened and the passenger seated in the left-side emergency exit row decided not to open the left exit.

The technique for controlling the direction of the aircraft on the runway is to use rudder assisted by nose wheel steering (NWS) at low speeds because the rudder has reduced effectiveness below 40 kt.
When rudder is used, the requirement for NWS to assist directional control will reduce progressively as speed increases above 40 kt and rudder effectiveness increases. It is likely that no assistance will be required by 60 kt and, therefore, there will be no step-change in NWS directional effect when the pilot releases the steering control. During this attempted takeoff, rudder was approximately neutral from 40 kt, the point at which it would have become effective, and directional control was probably maintained through NWS alone (asymmetric thrust or differential braking having been discounted). If rudder had been applied, there would have been a reduced NWS requirement at any given speed and therefore there would have been a reduced likelihood of a change directional effect when the NWS control was released. The lack of data showing NWS commands meant that these considerations could not be verified.";08:33;Saab 340B;null;Friday 2 January 2015

There were three crew members on board and all escaped unhurt. 
The flight crew indicated that they delayed their takeoff due to high wind conditions. Once the winds were within limits, they reported that startup was normal. Prior to takeoff, they decided to add 5 knots to their rotation speed, and power up slowly and as smoothly as possible.
The captain was the flying pilot. The first officer called critical engine failure recognition speed (V1) reference speed at 141 knots, and rotation speed (Vr) at 150 knots. The captain rotated the airplane, and it then lifted off about 7,000 feet down the 11,000-foot runway. About 20 feet above ground level (agl), the number two engine (left inboard) throttle lever slammed back to the idle position. The No. 2 engine pylon had separated from the left wing. The No. 2 engine nacelle and pylon assembly struck the No. 1 engine nacelle, causing the No. 1 engine inlet cowl to separate, which degraded the engine’s ability to produce thrust and resulted in a significant loss of thrust on the left side of the airplane.
The flight crew reported that the airplane began to drift to the left and descend. The captain lowered the pitch slightly and leveled the wings just prior to the airplane contacting the runway. He informed the other crew members that they were going to put it back down. He placed the throttle levers in the idle position, and activated the speed brakes. The airplane departed the left side of the runway surface; the crew reported a couple of impacts and then one final violent impact prior to the airplane coming to rest in a wetland marsh.
The flight crew had to force the cockpit door open due to debris that had piled up against it. They noted significant damage from the forward galley aft, and a large fire in the vicinity of the left wing. They opened the left main cabin door, and deployed the slide. They exited into the mud, and made it to dry land and away from the burning wreckage.
Investigators examined the wreckage at the accident site. The observed debris field extended 4,120 feet on a heading of 218 degrees. The first pieces of wreckage found along the debris path were fragments of the number two (left inboard) engine pylon; they were just past taxiway Alpha 2, about 7,500 feet from the beginning of runway 21. The number one engine (left outboard) nose cowl was about 450 feet further into the debris field and left of the runway surface in the grass infield.
The number two engine nose cowl was near the runway arresting gear on the left side of the runway at the 8,500 foot point. The number two engine was about 230 feet further, and on the left side of the runway surface.
The airplane departed the asphalt surface near taxiway Alpha 1, which was 9,500 feet from the departure end of the runway. Ground scars continued through the grass infield to taxiway Alpha at the end of the runway. The number one engine was in the grass infield near taxiway Alpha.
The main wreckage came to rest in a wetland marsh left of the runway overrun, and caught fire. Fire consumed the top of the cabin and the cockpit. The main wreckage consisted of the cockpit, cabin, right wing with the number three (right inboard) engine partially attached, empennage, and the inboard half of the left wing, which sustained thermal damage and was under water. Scattered debris aft of the main wreckage included the nose gear, remnants of the burned outboard left wing, right main landing gear truck, and number four (right outboard) engine.
A visual examination of a fracture surface on the number two engine pylon inboard mid-spar support fitting determined that it was flat and discolored with an arcing terminus.
The aircraft was registered and operated by Omega Air Inc., an air refueling contractor that uses specially-equipped and converted civilian airplanes to serve as air refueling platforms for the military. The flight was conducted under the provisions of a contract between Omega and the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) to provide aerial refueling of Navy F/A-18s in offshore warning area airspace.";17:27;Boeing 707-321B;Omega Air Refueling;Wednesday 18 May 2011

Sabreliner N3RP was inactive since October 2007, due to extensive maintenance to repair corrosion. The pilot and co-pilot were assigned by the operator to move the airplane to its home base at Hernando County Airport (BKV), Brooksville, Florida.
The maintenance facility released the Sabreliner to the pilots on February 1. The Sabreliner was located on the maintenance facility ramp in the northwest corner of Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport. The pilot and copilot boarded the airplane, started the APU, and started both engines.
About 15:40, the Sabreliner began to taxi out, and contacted the FXE ATCT ground controller to coordinate maneuvering around a Cessna Caravan that was headed in the opposite direction on the same ramp. The ground controller replied ""...don't have you in sight if you guys are in the foxtrot one ramp that is uncontrolled."" The accident crew responded that they were aware of that, but that they wanted to ""get out of the way"" of the Caravan. Ground control then asked for the accident crew's intentions, and at 15:42:04, the accident crew replied ""taxi out for departure and I'll get the clearance as soon as I get clear of the Caravan."" At 15:42:50 the Caravan pilot broadcast ""mayday mayday mayday watch out watch out watch out.""
According to the pilot of the Caravan, he had deplaned his passengers and was taxiing his airplane to its parking location. Since the Sabreliner was blocking his intended path, the Caravan pilot stopped to let the Sabreliner pass. He then saw the Sabreliner coming towards him, and the left wing of the Sabreliner struck the Caravan's propeller. The Sabreliner continued moving at a speed that the Caravan pilot estimated to be 10 knots, and the right wing of the Sabreliner struck a DH-125 that was under tow by a tug. The Sabreliner continued to move forward until it struck another, stationary Sabreliner (N430MP). The Caravan pilot estimated that the accident Sabreliner had traveled 20 to 30 yards beyond the Caravan before it finally stopped.

However, the airplane originally intended to be used for the flight was delayed in its arrival to Dallas/Fort Worth because of adverse weather in the area. After 21:00, the first officer notified gate agents that flight 1420 would need to depart by 23:16 because of American’s company duty time limitation. Another aircraft was arranged and the flight departed at 22:40. About 22:54, the flight dispatcher sent the flight crew an ACARS message indicating that the weather around Little Rock might be a factor during the arrival. The dispatcher suggested that the flight crew expedite the arrival to beat the thunderstorms if possible, and the flight crew acknowledged this message. About 23:04, the Fort Worth center broadcast an NWS Convective SIGMET [significant meteorological information] weather advisory for an area of severe thunderstorms that included the Little Rock airport area. The flight crew discussed the weather and the need to expedite the approach. At 23:25:47, the captain stated, ""we got to get over there quick."" About 5 seconds later, the first officer said, ""I don’t like that...that’s lightning,"" to which the captain replied, ""sure is."" The flight crew had the city of Little Rock and the airport area in sight by 23:26. Fort Worth center cleared the flight to descend to 10,000 feet msl. The flight was transferred to the Memphis ARTCC and at 23:34, the flight crew contacted the Little Rock Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). The controller advised the flight crew that a thunderstorm located northwest of the airport was moving through the area and that the wind was 280º at 28 knots gusting to 44 knots. The first officer told the controller that he and the captain could see the lightning. The controller told the flight crew to expect an ILS approach to runway 22L. At 23:36, the captain and first officer discussed American Airlines’ crosswind limitation for landing. The captain indicated that 30 knots was the crosswind limitation but realized that he had provided the limitation for a dry runway. The captain then stated that the wet runway crosswind limitation was 20 knots, but the first officer stated that the limitation was 25 knots. At 23:39:00, the controller cleared the flight to descend to an altitude of 3,000 feet msl. The controller then asked the flight crew about the weather conditions along the runway 22L final approach course, stating his belief that the airplane’s weather radar was ""a lot better"" than the weather radar depiction available in the tower. At 23:39:12, the first officer stated, ""okay, we can...see the airport from here. We can barely make it out but we should be able to make [runway] two two...that storm is moving this way like your radar says it is but a little bit farther off than you thought."" The controller then offered flight 1420 a visual approach to the runway, but the first officer indicated, ""at this point, we really can’t make it out. We’re gonna have to stay with you as long as possible."" At 23:39:45, the controller notified flight 1420 of a windshear alert, reporting that the centerfield wind was 340º at 10 knots, the north boundary wind was 330º at 25 knots, and the northwest boundary wind was 010º at 15 knots. The flight crew then requested runway 04R so that there would be a headwind, rather than a tailwind, during landing. At 23:40:20, the controller instructed the flight crew to fly a heading of 250º for vectors to the runway 04R ILS final approach course. After reaching the assigned heading, the airplane was turned away from the airport and clear of the thunderstorm that had previously been reported by the controller. Between 23:40:46 and 23:41:31, the first officer stated the localizer frequency and course, the decision altitude, the minimum safe altitude, and a portion of the missed approach procedure for runway 04R. The captain then asked the first officer, ""do you have the airport? Is that it right there? I don’t see a runway."" At 23:42:27, the controller told the flight crew that the second part of the thunderstorm was apparently moving through the area and that the winds were 340º at 16 knots gusting to 34 knots. At 23:42:40, the first officer asked the captain whether he wanted to accept ""a short approach"" and ""keep it in tight."" The captain answered, ""yeah, if you see the runway. ‘cause I don’t quite see it."" The first officer stated, ""yeah, it’s right here, see it?"" The captain replied, ""you just point me in the right direction and I’ll start slowing down here."" At 23:42:55, the first officer said, ""it’s going right over the...field."" The first officer then told the controller, ""well we got the airport. We’re going between clouds. I think it’s right off my, uh, three o’clock low, about four miles."" The controller then offered a visual approach for runway 04R, and the first officer accepted. At 23:43:11, the controller cleared flight 1420 for a visual approach to runway 04R and indicated ""if you lose it, need some help, let me know please."" At 23:43:35, the first officer stated, ""you’re comin’ in. There’s the airport."" Three seconds later, the captain stated, ""uh, I lost it,"" to which the first officer replied, ""see it’s right there."" The captain then stated, ""I still don’t see it...just vector me. I don’t know."" At 23:43:59, the controller cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the winds were 330º at 21 knots. At 23:44:19, the captain stated, ""see we’re losing it. I don’t think we can maintain visual."" At 23:44:30, the first officer informed the controller that visual contact with the airport had been lost because of a cloud between the airplane and the airport. The controller then cleared the airplane to fly a heading of 220º for radar vectors for the ILS approach to runway 04R and directed the flight to descend to and maintain 2,300 feet msl. At 23:45:47, the first officer told the controller ""we’re getting pretty close to this storm. we’ll keep it tight if we have to."" The controller indicated to the flight crew that, ""when you join the final, you’re going to be right at just a little bit outside the marker if that’s gonna be okay for ya."" The captain stated, ""that’s great,"" and the first officer told the controller, ""that’s great with us."" At 23:46:39, the controller advised the flight crew that the airplane was 3 miles from the outer marker. At 23:46:52, the captain stated, ""aw, we’re goin’ right into this."" At the same time, the controller reported that there was heavy rain at the airport, the ATIS information in effect at the time was no longer current, the visibility was less than 1 mile, and the runway visual range (RVR) for runway 04R was 3,000 feet. The first officer acknowledged this information. At 23:47:08, the controller again cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the wind was 350º at 30 knots gusting to 45 knots. The first officer then read back the wind information as 030º at 45 knots. At 23:47:22, the captain stated, ""three thousand RVR. We can’t land on that."" Four seconds later, the first officer indicated that the RVR for runway 04R was 2,400 feet, and the captain then said, ""okay, fine."" At 23:47:44, the captain stated, ""landing gear down."" About 5 seconds later, the captain stated, ""and lights please."" At 23:47:53, the controller issued a second windshear alert for the airport, reporting that the centerfield wind was 350º at 32 knots gusting to 45 knots, the north boundary wind was 310º at 29 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 32 knots. This transmission was not acknowledged by the flight crew. At 23:48:10, the captain stated, ""add twenty [knots],"" to which the first officer replied, ""right."" At 23:48:12, the controller reported that the runway 04R RVR was now 1,600 feet. About 23:48:18, the captain indicated that the flight was established on final approach; 6 seconds later, the first officer informed the controller that the flight was established on the inbound portion of the ILS. The controller repeated the clearance to land; stated that the wind was 340º at 31 knots, the north boundary wind was 300º at 26 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 25 knots; and repeated the RVR. At 23:48:41, the first officer acknowledged this information. The controller did not receive any further transmissions from flight 1420. At 23:49:02, the first officer asked the captain, ""want forty flaps?"" The captain indicated that he thought he had already called for the landing flaps, after which the first officer stated, ""forty now."" At 23:49:10, the controller informed the flight crew that the wind was 330º at 28 knots. Two seconds later, the captain stated, ""this is a can of worms."" The first officer stated, ""there’s the runway off to your right, got it?"" at 23:49:24. The captain replied, ""no,"" to which the first officer stated, ""I got the runway in sight. You’re right on course. Stay where you’re at."" The captain then stated, ""I got it. I got it."" At 23:49:32, the controller reported the wind to be 330º at 25 knots. At 23:49:53, the controller reported the wind to be 320º at 23 knots. From about 400 feet above field level (afl) the airplane drifted to the right. At 23:50:00, the first officer said, ""we’re way off."" The localizer deviation value was about one dot to the right at that point. About 1 second later, the captain stated, ""I can’t see it."" About 3 seconds afterward, the first officer asked, ""got it?"" to which the captain replied, ""yeah I got it."" At 23:50:13 and :14, the GPWS radio altitude callout ""sink rate"" sounded. The airplane touched down on the runway about 23:50:20. About 23:50:22, the first officer stated ""we’re down;"" about 2 seconds later, he stated, ""we’re sliding."" Over a 7-second period after touchdown, both thrust reversers were deployed and the left and right engines’ engine pressure ratios (EPR) reached settings of 1.89 and 1.67, respectively. The thrust reversers were subsequently moved to the unlocked status (neither deployed nor stowed). The flight spoilers did not deploy symmetrically at touchdown. About the time that the brakes were applied, the thrust reversers were deployed again. At 23:50:32, the CVR recorded an unidentified voice in the cockpit stating ""on the brakes."" The left engine reached a maximum setting of 1.98 reverse EPR, and the right engine reached a setting of 1.64 reverse EPR. The left brake pedal was relaxed at 23:50:34 before returning to its full position 2 seconds later. About the time that the left brake pedal was relaxed, the reversers were returned to the unlocked status. As the right thrust reverser was being moved to the unlocked status, the right engine reached a maximum setting of 1.74 reverse EPR. At 23:50:36, a full aileron deflection was given. At 23:50:40, the left thrust reverser was moved back to the deployed position, but the right reverser moved briefly to the deployed position and then moved to the stowed position. According to FDR data, the left thrust reverser remained deployed, and the right thrust reverser remained stowed, for the remainder of the flight. After departing the end of the runway, the airplane struck several tubes extending outward from the left edge of the instrument landing system localizer array, located 411 feet beyond the end of the runway; passed through a chain link security fence; went down a rock embankment to a flood plain, located approximately 15 feet below the runway elevation; and collided with the structure supporting the runway 22L approach lighting system.";23:51;McDonnell Douglas DC-9-82 (MD-82);American Airlines;Tuesday 1 June 1999

All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed.
Flight 4U9525 departed Barcelona, Spain at 10:00 hours local time (09:00 UTC) on a regular passenger service to Düsseldorf, Germany. The flight reached its cruising altitude of FL380 at 10:27 hours. At 10:30 hours the flight was cleared direct to the IRMAR waypoint, which was confirmed by the flight: ""Direct IRMAR, Merci 18G."" This was the last radio contact with the flight.
At 10:30:08, the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications, which the co-pilot acknowledged.
At 10:30:53, the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later, the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode. The aeroplane started to descend and both engines' speed decreased.
At 10:33:12, the speed management changed from managed mode to selected mode. One second later, the selected target speed became 308 kt while the aeroplane's speed was 273 kt. The aeroplane's speed started to increase along with the descent rate, which subsequently varied between 1,700 ft/min and 5,000 ft/min, then was on average about 3,500 ft/min.
The selected speed decreased to 288 kt. Then, over the following 13 seconds, the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt. 
At 10:33:47, the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for. The aeroplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent. There was no answer from the co-pilot. Over the following 30 seconds, the controller tried to contact the flight crew again on two occasions, without any answer.
Thereafter the selected speed increased up to 323 kt. Then the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded, but the copilot did not react.
Marseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight, without any response.
The selected speed was again increased, this time to 350 kt. Meanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door.
At the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies, without success.
As the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 10:39:30 and 10:40:28.

The crew entered a holding pattern to await an improvement in the weather. After 30 minutes in the hold and with continued deterioration in the visibility, the flight crew decided to divert to East Midlands (EMA). The weather at East Midlands required the crew to conduct a Category IIIA approach to runway 27. The approach was uneventful until, at approximately one mile from the runway threshold, the autopilot was momentarily disconnected and re-engaged. The aircraft then went above the glide-slope before developing a high rate of descent. At the same time, it deviated to the left of the centre-line. A go-around was initiated but the aircraft touched down heavily on the grass area to the left of the runway threshold. The right main landing gear broke off, causing damage to the right inboard flap, wing/body fairing and rear freight hold door and resulting in the loss of hydraulic System ‘A’. The aircraft continued for a short distance with the right engine, right outboard flap track fairing and right wing tip in contact with the ground before lifting off again. A Mayday was declared and the crew diverted to Birmingham (BHX) where weather conditions were good. An emergency landing was carried out on runway 33 at 05:02.

He also noticed the airplane was not on the taxiway, but on the grass area on the south side of the asphalt taxiway. At that time the ground was covered with snow and ice. The FBO representative noted the pilot did not activate the airport's taxi and runways lights via the common airport frequency radio channel. It was observed that the airplane taxied through a ditch, which was covered with ice and snow. The airplane's engines were heard at a high rate of power about this time.

The Boeing 737-800 registered PK-LOO operated on a flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on this flight. On board the flight were 181 persons, consisted of two pilots, five flight attendants and 174 passengers. The flight departed Makassar at 17:28 local time and cruised at an altitude of FL330. The flight until descent was uneventful.
Prior to commencing their descent, the crew received the latest weather information from the Jalaluddin Tower controller: wind calm, visibility 2,500 meters, slight rain, cloud FEW CB (cumulonimbus) 800 feet and overcast 800 feet, temperature 26°C, dew point 24 °C, QNH 1008 hPa and QFE 1006 hPa with additional remarks of CB in the approach area.
During the the descent, at 18:28, Jalaluddin Tower advised the pilot to descend to 5,800 feet and issued a clearance to carry out a VOR/DME approach to runway 27.
At 18:32, the Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that there was rain over the field and requested the aircrafts position. The PM acknowledged the information and reported that the aircraft was on final course runway 27.
One minute later a pilot of an ATR aircraft that previously landed informed to JT892 that when they were making the approach, there was heavy rain in the final approach area. The PM acknowledged the information. There was no pilot discussion to anticipate the reported heavy rain.
The Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind direction was 150° with velocity of 7 knots, QNH 1008 hPa and issued landing clearance if the pilot was able to see the runway. The PM acknowledged the message and would inform when they were able to see the runway.
The pilot requested for high intensity of runway lights and was informed that the runway light had been set to maximum intensity.
At 18:34, the PM informed the Jalaluddin Tower controller that the runway was in sight. The Jalaluddin Tower controller then issued landing clearance for JT892 since the controller was able to see the aircraft landing lights.
At 18:40, the aircraft touched down, the autobrake operated, the spoiler automatically deployed and the PF selected the engine thrust reversers. The pilots felt that suddenly the rain became very heavy and they were only able to see the runway lights on the left side of the runway. The crew felt an impact and then the aircraft stopped off the left side of the runway at approximately 1,200 meters from the beginning runway 27.
The pilot attempted to contact the Jalaluddin Tower controller but this was not received by the controller. The Jalaluddin Tower controller also attempted to contact the pilot, but the pilot did not receive the controllers message.
The Jalaluddin Tower controller could not clearly see the aircraft position however, the controller aware that the aircraft experienced an abnormality. The controller notified the Airport rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) using radio because the crash bell had not been connected to the ARFF station since the ARFF station moved to the new location a few months before.
All passengers were evacuated using escape slides on the forward cabin doors.


Lion Airlines flight JT892 suffered a runway excursion after landing on runway 27 in rain at Gorontalo, Indonesia. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, became stuck in muddy ground.

The first officer was flying the airplane. The captain reported they were cleared for the ILS runway 24R approach. Approximately 10 minutes prior to landing, air traffic control changed the landing runway to runway 28. The captain stated they were informed that the runway visual range (RVR) was 6,000 feet and that the braking action was fair. Also, the glideslope for the ILS runway 28 approach was unusable at the time of the accident due to the snow. After passing the final approach fix, they were informed that the RVR had decreased to 2,000 feet. The captain had the approach lights in sight and at 50 feet above the ground, he had the runway in sight. The first officer then turned off the autopilot to land. At 30 feet above the ground the captain momentarily lost sight of the runway. He then regained sight of the runway and the airplane was landed. They encountered strong gusty winds during the landing flare and after touchdown they could barely see the runway lights and taxiway turn-offs. Despite the use of full reverse and braking, the airplane did not seem to slow down. The airplane traveled off the runway and into the snow covered grass and went partially through the fence before coming to a stop more than 150 feet past the end of the runway.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM), Canada;"Jazz Aviation flight JZA7795 was a scheduled domestic flight from Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Canada, to Sault Ste. Marie Airport.
On board the DHC-8-102 aircraft were 15 passengers, 2 flight crew members, and 1 cabin crew member. The captain performed the role of pilot flying (PF) and the first officer performed the role of pilot monitoring (PM).
Just prior to descent from cruise altitude, the PF briefed the PM for the expected approach into Sault Ste. Marie. The PF was aware of the marginal weather conditions and included the possibility of a go-around and diversion in the briefing.
As part of the briefing, the flight crew set the approach speed bugs to the appropriate speed for aircraft weight and flight conditions. The crew determined that the applicable landing reference speed (Vref) was 96 knots, which required an approach speed bug setting of 101 knots.
When the aircraft was approximately 42 nautical miles (nm) from CYAM, the controller at the Toronto Area Control Centre cleared the flight to descend to 5000 feet above sea level (ASL) and, given the expected weather conditions, requested that the crew report when they had the airport in sight for the visual approach.
As JZA7795 reached 15 nm from Sault Ste. Marie in level flight at 5000 feet ASL, the crew reported that the in-flight visibility was reduced due to ice crystals. In consideration of this, they requested to be cleared for the VOR/DME approach to runway 30, rather than the visual approach, and were cleared as requested.
While descending out of 3000 feet ASL, the flight crew passed through the area of ice crystals and acquired the airport visually. Although the flight was now in visual conditions, the crew noticed a significant snow shower approaching the arrival runway from the west. They reported these conditions to the controller, who cleared the flight for the visual approach, instructing them to deviate as necessary from the VOR approach.
At 18:21:34 the aircraft passed over the final approach fix, 8.7 nm from the runway threshold, at a height of 2840 feet above ground level (AGL) and an indicated airspeed of 204 knots. The aircraft was descending on a 3° vertical path, although this was done visually, rather than with avionics-based vertical navigation guidance.
The aircraft slowly decelerated from 204 to 181 knots while maintaining the 3° vertical path in descent from 2840 feet to 1500 feet.
At 18:22:50, when JZA7795 was 5 nm from Sault Ste. Marie, the flight crew contacted the Sault Ste. Marie control tower for landing clearance. The controller informed the crew that the wind was from 310° magnetic (M) at 22 knots with gusts to 29 knots, and mentioned the line of weather currently rolling across the runway. The controller further informed the crew that, due to this weather, the runway visual range (RVR) visibility had decreased to 1100 feet, with the runway lights set to level 4 intensity. The PM responded that they could see the approaching weather.
At 18:23:05 and at 1500 feet, the power levers were moved toward flight idle and the engine torque reduced to between 3% and 4%. The aircraft began to decelerate more rapidly.
The tower controller then informed JZA7795 that the RVR had now reduced to 1000 feet, with the runway lights now at level 5 (full) intensity. Wind was reported as from 310°M at 25 knots, and JZA7795 was cleared to land.
At 18:23:49, at 1000 feet and 2.8 nm from the runway threshold, the flaps were extended to 15° and the PF increased torque to 25%. The aircraft's airspeed was 148 knots.
Between 1000 feet and 500 feet on approach, the aircraft generally maintained the 3° vertical path as the speed decreased from 148 to 122 knots. The engine torque varied during that time between 5% and 30% to account for configuration changes and wind gusts.
At 500 feet, the airspeed was 122 knots, or 21 knots higher than the bugged approach speed of 101 knots. The aircraft was on the appropriate vertical path and torque was steady at 25%. The PF made the 8° left turn to align the aircraft with the runway heading.
At 18:24:56, air traffic control (ATC) provided one last update to JZA7795, stating that the RVR was now 1200 feet.
At 200 feet and at an airspeed of 124 knots, the PF began to reduce torque to idle and, as a result, the airspeed began to decrease rapidly. Although the aircraft's nose-up pitch was gradually increased and vertical speed was relatively stable, the vertical path steepened due to the decreasing airspeed and resultant ground speed reduction. The aircraft drifted below the 3° vertical path. This would normally be visually indicated by 4 red lights on the precision approach path indicator (PAPI), meaning the aircraft is too low.
At some point below 200 feet, the flight crew lost visual reference to the ground due to the approaching weather system of blowing snow. The approach was continued.
At 18:25:15, the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) issued a verbal alert to the pilots indicating that the aircraft's height was 50 feet.
Then, at 20 feet, torque was increased toward 30%. At 18:25:19, the aircraft contacted the ground approximately 450 feet (137 meters) prior to the runway threshold at an airspeed of 94 knots.
The ground preceding the runway was covered in approximately 8 to 12 inches of snow.
The aircraft was in a level pitch attitude when it contacted the surface and touched down with a peak vertical acceleration of 2.32g.
Following touchdown, the nose landing gear assembly and wheel struck and damaged an approach light located 300 feet prior to the runway threshold. The flight crew heard a thump, but had not seen the light and were unsure what had caused the noise.
The aircraft came to a stop on the runway centreline, approximately 1500 feet past the threshold. The flight crew assessed the ground visibility as very poor, due to the blowing snow.
Unsure of the aircraft's status, the flight crew informed the tower controller that the aircraft may have landed short of the runway and may have clipped the nosewheel. The crew asked the control tower to send a vehicle to their position to assess the situation, and requested that a bus be sent to move the passengers.
When the emergency vehicles arrived and assessed the condition of the aircraft, no significant damage was noticed. Upon receiving this information, the flight crew elected to taxi the aircraft to the gate.
The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident, and the crew shut down the engines and deplaned the passengers.
The crew did not believe there was damage to the aircraft and, therefore, did not pull the circuit breaker to prevent the cockpit voice recorder data from being overwritten. As a result, relevant data that would have been captured on the 30-minute cockpit voice recorder was overwritten while the aircraft remained electrically powered at the gate.
After exiting the aircraft at the gate, the crew was notified of damage to an approach light and contacted maintenance to have the aircraft inspected.
The aircraft sustained significant damage, mostly localized to the area near the nose landing gear, which had struck the approach light.
The nose gear and nose gear doors were damaged and required replacement. Additionally, both main landing gear were determined to have exceeded load limits and required replacement.";18:25;de Havilland Canada DHC-8-102;null;Tuesday 24 February 2015

There were 291 passengers and 16 crew members on board. Three passengers died and 48 were seriously injured.
Flight OZ-214 originated in Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN), South Korea were it departed at 16:35 local Korean time. Destination of the flight was San Francisco, CA. 
The weather at San Francisco was fine with 6-7 knot winds and a visibility of 10+ miles. The pilot undergoing initial operating experience was in the left hand seat as Pilot Flying. An instructor pilot was sitting in the right hand seat. The relief first officer was in the jump seat at the time of the approach.
The pilot flying had logged about 9700 flying hours. Flight 214 was his tenth flight leg on a Boeing 777 while undergoing initial operating experience.
The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 28L, the ILS glidepath of which had been declared unserviceable in the current Notam.
The airplane was configured for landing with 30 degrees of flaps and gear down. Target threshold speed was 137 knots. According to preliminary information from the cockpit voice recorder, the crew did not state and anomalies or concerns during the approach. The throttles were at idle and autothrottle armed. 
At 1600 feet the autopilot was disengaged. The aircaft descended through an altitude of 1400 ft at 170 kts and slowed down to 149 kts at 1000 feet.
At 500 feet altitude, 34 seconds prior to impact, the speed dropped to 134 kts, which was just below the target threshold speed. The airspeed then dropped significantly, reaching 118 knots at 200 feet altitude. The instructor pilot reported that he noticed four red PAPI lights and concluded that the autothrottle had not maintained speed.
Eight seconds prior to impact, the throttles were moved forward. Airspeed according to the FDR, was 112 knots at an altitude of 125 feet. Seven seconds prior to impact, one of the crew members made a call to increase speed. 
The stick shaker sounded 4 seconds prior to impact. One second later the speed was 103 knots, the lowest recorded by the FDR. One of the crew members made a call for go a around at 1.5 seconds before impact. The throttles were advanced and the engines appeared to respond normally. 
The main landing gear and rear fuselage then struck a sea wall, just short of runway 28L. Airspeed was 106 knots. The empennage separated at the rear bulkhead. 
The airplane then ballooned, yawed left and spun 360 degrees before it came to rest to the left of runway 28L, 735 m (2400 ft) from the seawall.
A post impact fire occurred when a fuel tank ruptured inboard of the no. 2 engine, spilling fuel on the hot engine, causing it to ignite.

All four passengers and two crew members were not injured. The airplane operated on Hageland flight 161 from Bethel Airport, AK (BET) to Kipnuk Airport, AK (KPN).
Following a normal approach to runway 33, the captain landed long to avoid a bump in the runway. As the airplane touched down on the runway, he applied brakes and moved the propeller into beta. During the landing roll, he realized the airplane was still traveling fast, and he did not have enough area to abort the landing, so he applied maximum brakes. The airplane continued off the departure end (north side) of runway 33, and impacted a ditch, which resulted in the airplane coming to rest right wing and nose low. The captain said that at the time of the accident, the runway contained packed snow and ice.
Examination of the airplane by the captain revealed that the right wing was bent upwards about 3 to 4 feet inboard from the wingtip.";13:26;Cessna 208B Grand Caravan;Hageland Aviation Services;Thursday 6 January 2011

There was no fire, and the flight crew was not injured.
At approximately 15:00, the aircraft departed runway 05 at Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ) for a ferry flight to Buttonville. At 15:03, the Toronto ACC controller cleared the aircraft for a contact approach to runway 33, to begin the descent, and to keep the approach tight, as there was traffic to follow. At that point, the aircraft was approximately 3 nm from the airport, descending through 2600 feet asl with a ground speed of 230 knots, and heading towards the threshold of runway 33 on a tight left base.
Then the crew was instructed to switch to the Buttonville tower frequency. The Buttonville tower controller provided altimeter information and cleared the aircraft to land on Runway 33. At this time, the aircraft was descending through 1400 feet asl with a ground speed of 210 knots, and was located approximately 0.3 nm from the inbound track to runway 33. The aircraft levelled out from the right turn and was heading in an eastward direction. It flew through the inbound track at a transverse angle of about 120° at approximately 1 nm final. In an attempt to regain the runway centreline, the aircraft banked left, exceeding 30° of bank. The aircraft overflew the runway centreline by approximately 0.3 nm.
At 15:04, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) issued an aural alert to pull up. A missed approach was called by the FO in a low tone of voice and using non-standard phraseology. The captain responded, but continued the approach. Shortly afterwards, the GPWS sounded another aural alert to pull up.
The aircraft was approximately 300 feet above ground level, 0.7 nm south of runway 33 and 0.3 nm east of the inbound track, in a left bank towards the runway threshold. The captain called for full flaps and banked the aircraft steeply to the right after regaining the runway centreline while on short final.
The FO reminded the captain of the landing reference speed (Vref), 4 and twice called out Vref plus 5 knots.
At 15:04:49, the aircraft touched down hard on the main landing gear in a nose-high attitude, then immediately departed the runway surface to the right. The ground speed during the runway excursion could not be determined, but was estimated to be less than 110 knots. The captain applied the brakes and initially attempted to steer the aircraft onto the runway using the rudder. However, due to the infield's grass surface, braking and steering responses were minimal. Although the tiller was available for nose-wheel steering, it is not normally used until the speed is below 80 knots.
The aircraft traversed the grass infield to the intersection of taxiways Charlie and Bravo, continued onto taxiway Bravo, and struck a runway/taxiway identification sign before crossing the intersection of taxiways Bravo and Alpha. The aircraft struck the sign with the right side of the nose section, the inboard leading edge and the right-wing slats. The sign was struck with sufficient force that it was torn away from its base and came to rest behind the aircraft on the apron. The aircraft came to a stop on the grass just beyond the intersection of taxiways Bravo and Bravo/Alpha.";15:04;Dassault Falcon 10;Skycharter;Friday 17 June 2011

The airplane incurred substantial left wing damage when the left main landing gear collapsed during the overrun. 
The purpose of the flight was a test flight following the installation of the airplane's interior prior to delivery of the airplane to its owner. The flight departed from Appleton about 10:10. The flight returned about three hours later.
While the airplane was inside the final approach fix, an amber left side hydraulic quantity low crew alerting system (CAS) message illuminated. The pilot flying (PF) noticed the hydraulic fluid quantity decreasing. Subsequently, an amber left hydraulic system fail CAS message appeared. The pilot not flying (PNF) pulled out the checklist to accomplish the left hydraulic system failure procedures and then suggested a go-around because the landing runway was about 500 feet shorter than the recommended minimum runway length indicated in the checklist. The PF decided to land due to the hydraulic quantity indications, prior autopilot problems, and the airplane's landing configuration. The PNF turned on the auxiliary pump about 500 feet above ground level, and both the PF and PNF thought the auxiliary hydraulic system could support normal spoilers, brakes, and nosewheel steering. The PF selected right thrust reverser aft and began pressing the brakes, but he felt no braking action. He reached for the emergency brakes; however, he did not immediately apply them to slow the airplane because he decided that there was not enough distance remaining to stop the airplane on the runway. Therefore, he attempted to go around with insufficient runway remaining by advancing the throttles to the maximum continuous thrust setting. The PNF did not see the airspeed increase and believed that not enough runway remained to get airborne, so he pulled the throttles back to avoid a runway overrun. The airplane exited the runway and sustained substantial damage. A review of the cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that, before the emergency, the flight crew did not maintain a disciplined cockpit environment that focused on operationally relevant discussion but instead repeatedly made reference to and discussed objects on the ground and other operationally irrelevant topics. The lack of a sterile cockpit did not promote crew coordination and communication and adherence to procedures, which would have helped mitigate this emergency.";13:15;Gulfstream GV-SP (G550);Gulfstream Aerospace;Monday 14 February 2011

The pilots were not injured. The airplane was operated by a private company. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated at Caracas-Simón Bolívar International Airport, Venezuela about 16:30.
The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to fly the airplane to FXE for scheduled maintenance. About 2 hours and 15 minutes after departure, at flight level 430, the crew observed a red warning light indicating a maximum cabin differential pressure of 9.8 psi, followed by a red ""DOOR MAIN"" indication. The pilots donned oxygen masks and referenced the airplane's quick reference handbook. A loud ""bam"" sound was then heard in the cabin and the crew initiated an immediate descent. The cabin pressure outflow valve was opened manually and the airplane was leveled at 12,000 feet above mean sea level. The flight continued to FXE unpressurized and landed without further incident. After landing, the crew performed a walk-around inspection and found no obvious anomalies with the airplane.
A subsequent inspection of the airplane by maintenance and engineering personnel revealed structural airframe damage, including a cracked floor beam, dimpled areas in the floor boards, damaged structure between ribs, and damaged wing links.

The aircraft departed Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at Mitú, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold. The crew carried out a go around and returned to Yopal. En route the no. 1 engine was shut down because of low oil pressure. The Caravelle flew over the control tower at Yopal twice to determine the state of the undercarriage. It appeared that part of the left main landing gear was missing. The crew then positioned the plane for an approach and landing. As the plane turned into long final it struck the ground, crash-landed in a meadow and caught fire. The cargo consisted of a.o. 14 barrels with 55 gallons of gasoline each.;16:49;Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle 10R;Líneas Aéreas Suramericanas;Wednesday 31 January 2001

The three flight crew members and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the night cross-country flight, which originated from Seattle, Washington, 2 hours 48 minutes before the accident. An IFR flight plan had been filed for the cargo flight that was en route to Dayton, Ohio.

The captain said that they were in cruise flight at 37,000 feet mean sea level (msl). He said that they heard a loud bang and the airplane shook, and they immediately began to lose cabin pressurization. The engine instruments went dead on number two- engine, and they pulled the number two emergency ""T"" handle. He said that they donned their oxygen masks, began descending, and diverted to Denver. Their landing was uneventful.
Post landing examination of the number two-engine nacelle revealed that the inboard and outboard main engine cowlings had separated from the aircraft. An 18x6 inch hole was found half way up the fuselage (pressure bulkhead), just aft of the left wing; the left horizontal stabiliser was also damaged. Further examination of the engine revealed that the 4 inch-diameter high pressure bleed air duct had separated from the high-pressure relief valve, and the connecting clamp was missing. The clamp was never located.
The wire bundle, which transmitted the number two engine monitoring data to the cockpit, was found cut. There was no evidence of engine fire, or fire in the nacelle cavity.

According to the operator: ""when the clamp assembly failed, high pressure bleed air from the 4 inch diameter duct dumped into the area inside of the engine cowlings. The sudden over-pressurization probably expanded the main engine cowlings into the air stream, leading to the loss of the cowlings. The amount of airflow from the high pressurization bleed air duct far exceeds the air discharge capacities of the cowling blow out panels.""";21:30;McDonnell Douglas DC-8-62F;Emery Worldwide;Thursday 27 April 2000

Four crew members and seven passengers sustained serious injuries.
Iran Air Flight IR235 was a scheduled service from Tehran to Shiraz. The co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying, performed a walk around prior to departure. Since it had been snowing and temperatures were around freezing level, he requested de-icing.
Because there were a number of aircraft already waiting for de-icing, the pilot in command decided not to perform de-icing. The engines were started and the airplane started taxying towards the departure runway at 07:09 hours. At 07:31 the flight was cleared for takeoff.
The aircraft rolled left wing down shortly after lift off. The left wingtip touched the ground. Thereafter the aircraft rolled momentarily back to a more neutral position. A few seconds later, while losing altitude, the second left wing down roll started. The left wing touched the ground and when the aircraft rolled back to a more neutral attitude both main landing gears touched the ground. All gears broke off and the aircraft slid on the area next to the runway.
Reportedly, during the impact or shortly thereafter all electrical power was lost.
When the aircraft came to rest, a fire developed, starting from the left wing root towards the fuselage. All passengers and crew were evacuated through the two right over wing emergency exits.";07:32;Fokker 100;Iran Air;Wednesday 2 January 2008

It was scheduled to arrive at Lihue at 05:15. The pilot had routine contact with air traffic control, and was advised by the controller to maintain 6,000 feet at 05:01 when the airplane was 11 miles from the destination airport. Two minutes later the flight was cleared for a visual approach to follow a preceding Boeing 737 (Aloha Airlines Flight 917) and advised to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency at the airport. The pilot altered his flight course to the west, most likely for spacing from the airplane ahead, and descended into the water as he began a turn back toward the airport. The majority of the wreckage sank in 4,800 feet of water.
The pilot most likely descended into the ocean because he became spatially disoriented. Although visual meteorological conditions prevailed, no natural horizon and few external visual references were available during the visual approach. This increased the importance of monitoring flight instruments to maintain awareness of the airplane attitude and altitude. The pilot's tasks during the approach, however, included maintaining visual separation from the airplane ahead and lining up with the destination runway. These tasks required visual attention outside the cockpit. These competing tasks probably created shifting visual frames of reference, left the pilot vulnerable to common visual and vestibular illusions, and reduced his awareness of the airplane's attitude, altitude and trajectory.";05:08;Beechcraft 1900C-1;Alpine Aviation;Monday 14 January 2008

The flight was carried out by DC-9-51 N763NC. After takeoff, at some point below 4,000 feet altitude, when the slats were retracted, the MASTER CAUTION light illuminated. The co-pilot, who was pilot flying, observed the RUDDER CONTROL MANUAL annunciator light and then saw that the right hydraulic system pressure was about 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSI). The right engine hydraulic pump switch was selected to 'off' and the flight was continued while the captain referred to the NWA DC-9 Cockpit Operating Manual (COM) to complete the procedures. He also discussed the problem with maintenance control on the ground. The approach and landing at Minneapolis were briefed thoroughly. Approximately 18:50, the captain contacted dispatch to request that they ""call out the trucks"" for their arrival. At 19:01 the captain radioed to MSP center ""ah we got a hydraulic problem, we're gonna go ahead and declare an emergency. ah everything should be okay but just gonna have to land a little faster and we're gonna have the trucks standing and everything."" The landing gear was extended early in the approach because the crew was uncertain if they would have to use the Emergency Gear Extension Handle. This was not necessary as the gear extended successfully. The first officer flew a long slow downwind from Farmington to a downwind leg to runway 22. He turned onto the localizer course at an altitude about 3,000 feet. The flight was then cleared for the approach to runway 22. A safe landing was carried out at 19:23. After landing the flaps were retracted and the After Landing checklist was completed. The crew received taxi instructions, and after crossing runway 30L, he made a right turn onto taxiway A. They made a slight gradual turn into the gate area. He had just started to turn into the gate from taxiway A when the nose wheel steering failed. The first officer then advised Ground Control that they were experiencing steering problems and would probably have to be towed to the gate. He then called MAINT and told them the same thing. Then the captain 
lost the brakes. The first officer stated that he saw the captain's hands ""come up"" and apply reverse thrust. The airplane came to a stop. The first officer stated that he called maintenance again and told them that they had lost steering and brakes and that they needed to have the airplane chocked. maintenance asked if they would shut down the engines and the captain said, no, he needed them first officer the reversers. The first officer stressed that they needed to get somebody out there right away; they were in a very precarious situation. maintenance said they would have somebody out as soon as they could.

The airplane landed at Atlantic City (ACY) at 13:13 where two passengers deplaned. At 13:47 the jet continued on to Groton (GON). The crew briefed the runway 05 ILS approach, including the missed approach procedures. Weather at the time included a 100-foot broken cloud layer, and at the airport, 2 miles visibility. The approach was flown over water, and at the accident location, there was dense fog. Two smaller airplanes had successfully completed the approach prior to the accident airplane. The captain flew the approach and the first officer made 100-foot callouts during the final descent, until 200 feet above the decision height. At that point, the captain asked the first officer if he saw anything. The first officer reported ""ground contact,"" then noted ""decision height."" The captain immediately reported ""I got the lights"" which the first officer confirmed. The captain reduced the power to flight idle. Approximately 4 seconds later, the captain attempted to increase power. However, the engines did not have time to respond before the airplane descended into the water and impacted a series of approach light stanchions, commencing about 2,000 feet from the runway. Neither crew member continued to call out altitudes after seeing the approach lights, and the captain descended the airplane below the decision height before having the requisite descent criteria. The absence of ground references could have been conducive to a featureless terrain illusion in which the captain would have believed that the airplane was at a higher altitude than it actually was.

The flight was cleared for a runway 28 RNAV (GNSS) approach. During the approach a local transient fog layer moved over the airport. The Runway Visual Range in the touchdown zone decreased rapidly as low as 350 m. After that, the value recovered and returned to the value of more than 1,800 m. After the pilot in command and the first officer talked that the appearance of the runway was slightly odd, Hiroshima Tower reported a Touchdown RVR of 1,700 m. After that the captain disengaged the autopilot. At that time the aircraft was flying at 1000 feet above airfield elevation. 
The aircraft then descended below the normal 3° glide path. At decision altitude, the captain called, ""Continue,"" and continued descending. Immediately after this, the first officer concernedly said, ""Runway was not in sight."" At this stage, the approach path was getting even lower but still remained uncorrected. 
The captain said, ""Wait a second,"" as the aircraft descended to a position which indicated four red lights on the PAPI, if visible. The captain instructed the first officer to check radio altitude carefully. Afterward, an Auto Radio Altitude call of ""300 ft"" and ""200 ft"" were announced in a short interval, then, the captain called out for executing a go-around, and commenced raising the nose. Accordingly, the pitch angle of the aircraft was just about to increase; however, immediately after that, the aircraft collided with the Localizer antenna array, which is located 325 m before the runway 28 threshold. 
The aircraft collided with the central parts of the LOC frame stand 6 m high with the both engines, both main landing gears, the flaps, the lower surface of fuselage and the horizontal stabilizers. Having collided with the LOC frame stand, the aircraft badly damaged lights of SALS and touched down on the grass area short of the runway 28 threshold with the fuselage tail, followed by the right and left main wheels followed.
The aircraft smashed down ORL lights and proceeded on the runway. The left main gear folded due to severe damage, causing the left engine cowling to touch the runway surface. Subsequently, the airplane gradually veered off the runway to the left finally coming to a stop facing the southeast at the position in front of the airport boundary fence.
When the purser came into the cockpit, she was told to wait and the captain gave priority to performing the Emergency Evacuation Checklist.
Back in the cabin she heard flight attendants in the rear of the cabin calling and it seemed that smoke was coming up in the rear. She decided that an emergency evacuation was required, and proceeded to the forward left hand (L1) door. Having confirmed the inflation of the evacuation slide, she instructed the passengers to evacuate. The flight attendants then also began evacuating the passengers.

The flight was intended to be the first training flight of the newly hired second-in-command (SIC) pilot. The SIC was operating from the airplane's right seat during the training.
The airplane departed Bethel Airport, Alaska, at 15:35. After departure, the airplane began a series of training maneuvers, consistent with normal operations. About 21 minutes into the flight, when the airplane was about 3,400 ft mean sea level, it began a steep descent and subsequently impacted terrain. An airplane performance study showed that the airplane reached a nose-down pitch of about -40 degrees and that the descent rate reached about 16,000 ft per minute. 
The NTSB determined that it is likely that the check airman simulated a pitch trim excursion and that the trainee, who lacked experience in the airplane type, did not appropriately respond to the excursion. The check airman did not take remedial action and initiate the recovery procedure in time to prevent the control forces from becoming unmanageable and to ensure that recovery from the associated dive was possible.

There were 203 passengers and 11 crew members on board. One crew member and 29 passengers were killed.
The aircraft was operated with a deactivated no. 1 engine reverser as per Minimum Equipment List (MEL) procedures, being a carry forward defect. This was accepted by the pilot who operated the return flight from Khartoum to Amman.
Sudan Airways Flight 109 was the return leg from Amman, Jordan to Khartoum, Sudan with an en route stop at Damascus, Syria. The airplane diverted to Port Sudan due to inclement weather at Khartoum. After staying on ground at Port Sudan for about 1:15 hour, and being informed that the weather was getting better, the captain decided to continue to Khartoum. 
Weather was poor with CB clouds and a thunderstorm as the Airbus approached Khartoum. The flight was cleared to land on runway 36 with wind information given as 320 degrees at 7 knots. In reality however, there was a 15 knot tail wind. The runway was reported being wet. 
The Airbus touched down 900 metres past the runway threshold and the captain selected both thrust reversers to maximum reverse. Reverser no. 2 deployed normally and no. 1 remained stowed. Because of asymmetrical reverse, the airplane skidded to the right. Ten seconds after touch down both reversers were stowed and thrust levers were set to idle. The captain put the aircraft back to the centre line by using differential braking. The captain then switched the anti-skid off and applied full braking on both pedals, causing the wheels to lock. The aircraft longitudinally overran the runway and came to a stop 215 meters after the runway end. Then it caught fire on its right side.
Fire services arrived late at the scene of the accident due to acute shortage in fire fighting personnel, and the fact that there was no means of communication between the fire station and the vehicles.";20:26;Airbus A310-324;Sudan Airways;Tuesday 10 June 2008

The departure and en route portions of the flight to Fox Harbour were unremarkable until preparation for the descent. The owner of the IAI Astra jet had made it clear to this crew, and to other crews on previous occasions, that he expected arrivals and approaches to be flown in minimum time. The operating crew and other employees confirmed this pressure, and aircrew therefore planned and conducted their operations accordingly. In preparation for the arrival and the approach to Fox Harbour, the crew inserted a series of waypoints in the flight management system to guide them for a straight-in approach and landing on runway 33.
In general, the descent was flown at high speed on a track following the navigation waypoints programmed in the flight management system by the crew. Speed brakes were required to slow the aircraft during the descent. Example speeds show that the aircraft was at 340 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) at 10 000 feet, 310 KIAS at 5000 feet, and 250 KIAS at 1000 feet. At 1000 feet, the aircraft was levelled and decelerated to configure for approach and landing. About this time, there was a slight quartering tailwind component, estimated to be about six knots. Because the speed was high throughout the descent, flaps and landing gear selections were delayed and, consequently, not fully extended until about three miles from the runway. At this time, the co-pilot went ""heads down"" to ensure that all checklist items were complete and to confirm that the aircraft was properly configured to land. When he next looked up, he observed that the aircraft was low in relationship to the runway and advised the captain, who corrected by levelling the aircraft. The aircraft altitude was recorded on radar to be between 200 and 300 feet above sea level while tracking inbound to the airport. A short distance before the tree line the aircraft began descending again. The co-pilot saw trees between the aircraft and the runway and called for an overshoot. The captain had begun the overshoot on the co-pilot's call; however, the action was not taken in time to avoid striking the trees.
About 50 feet above ground level and 1300 feet from the threshold of runway 33, the aircraft struck the trees and descended 10 feet into the treetops, then climbed away. Damage to the aircraft comprised wing leading-edge dents, minor fuselage perforations, leading- and trailing-edge flap dents and perforations, nose and landing-gear door damage, and foreign object damage to both engines. Tree debris was entangled in the landing gear; some of this debris fell from the aircraft during the overshoot. Debris that entered the engines subsequently resulted in an odour of burning wood and some smoke in the cabin.
Once the aircraft began climbing on the overshoot, the crew raised the landing gear and the trailing-edge flaps. Both systems functioned normally. The initial decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps was re-examined during the overshoot climb, resulting in the leading-edge flaps being left extended. The crew contacted air traffic control on the overshoot, declared an emergency, and requested clearance to Charlottetown. Charlottetown was chosen because it was nearby and clearly visible from Fox Harbour, had landing aids, and had airport emergency response services. The aircraft continued to Charlottetown for a straight-in approach and an uneventful landing and shutdown.";null;IAI 1125 Astra SPX;Jetport Inc.;Wednesday 22 March 2000

Both pilots were killed.
The airplane took off from runway 10 at San Juan-Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport bound for Sint Maarten-Juliana Airport (SXM). It carried 12100 pounds of cargo mainly consisting of bread. Shortly after takeoff the captain declared an emergency, stating that they wanted to return to the airport. They reported smoke coming from one of the engines. Air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 10, but the crew requested runway 28 for landing. This was approved and the controller cleared N153JR to land, stating that the wind was ""150 at 3"".
The flight came down in the Torrecilla Lagoon on the east side of the airport. It sank in 30-50 feet of water.

Investigation showed that the estimated ramp weight of the airplane was 47,710 lbs. The Convair CV-440’s maximum allowable takeoff weight of 48,000 lbs requires use of both the antidetonation injection and autofeather systems; however, because neither system was used on the accident flight, the maximum allowable takeoff weight was 40,900 lbs.
Flight crew injuries were consistent with the first officer flying the airplane at the time of impact; however, considering the first officer’s limited recent experience in the Convair CV-440 and the performance deficiencies identified in his training and certification history, he was likely not capable of handling the emergency without help from the captain.
The captain on the other hand was likely suffering from acute sleep loss at the time of the accident, which would have negatively affected his ability to guide the first officer in properly handling the emergency.";07:38;Convair CV-440-38;Jet One Express;Thursday 15 March 2012

The captain, first officer, and sole passenger were not injured. 
The captain was the pilot-flying during the accident flight. After departure, the flight had to circumnavigate around numerous thunderstorms that affected the planned route of flight. When the flight was within 25 nautical miles (nm) of its intended destination, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight plan and concluded the flight under visual flight rules. 
The captain noted the wind was from 310 degrees at 19 knots, gusting 27 knots. A 5 nm straight-in final approach was flown to runway 36 (5,500 feet by 100 feet). The captain reported that the landing reference speed (Vref) was 110 knots, which included a 5 knot gust factor. As the airplane touched down on its main landing gear, it encountered a wind gust that raised the left wing. The captain corrected with a left roll input as he simultaneously reduced the airplane's pitch in an attempt to place the nose wheel onto the runway, but the airplane became airborne and drifted off the runway. The airplane touched down for the second time in the grassy area alongside the runway where the subsequent landing roll was completed without further incident. The captain reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.

A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed that the right main landing gear had shifted/twisted inside the wheel well damaging both forward and aft spar assemblies. Additionally, the aft movement of the nose landing gear had damaged the forward pressure bulkhead.

He attempted to manually extend the landing gear, but was unable to confirm that the landing gear had locked in position for the subsequent precautionary landing. The main landing gear collapsed as the aircraft touched down.
Examination of the aircraft landing gear by the aircraft operator revealed an incorrectly installed thrust bearing in the hydraulic actuator for the left main landing gear. The result was that the axial loads normally carried by the thrust bearing were transferred to the actuator's pinion gears which fractured under abnormal operational loads.

All 103 passengers and seven crew members survived but ten sustained serious injuries.
Merpati Flight MNA836 operated on a scheduled flight from Sorong-Dominique Edward Osok Airport (SOQ/WAXX). Departure was delayed for almost three hours due to heavy rain over Manokwari.
The flight was planned under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Manokwari, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
At 10:46 the crew made the first direct contact with Rendani Radio and reported their position as 14 Nm from Manokwari, and maintaining altitude 10,500 feet. Following this radio contact, Rendani Radio informed the crew that the weather was continuous slight rain, visibility 3 kilometers, cloud overcast with cumulus-stratocumulus at 1,400 feet, temperature 24 degrees Celsius, QNH 1012 hectopascals.
The controller then instructed the crew to descend and joint right downwind for runway 35, and to report when overhead the airport. Shortly after, the crew reported overhead the airport at 5,000 feet. The controller then instructed the crew to report when they were on final approach for runway 35. The crew acknowledged this instruction.
At 10:54 the crew reported that they were on final for runway 35. The controller informed them that the wind was calm, runway condition was wet and clear.
The crew read back the wind condition and that the runway was clear, but did not mention the wet runway condition.
The aircraft was observed to make a normal touchdown on the runway, about 120 meters from the approach end of runway 35. Witnesses on the ground and on board reported that engine reverser sound was not heard during landing roll. 
During the landing roll, the aircraft veered to the left about 140 meters from the end of runway 35, then overran the departure end of runway 35. It came to a stop 205 meters beyond the end of the runway in a narrow river; the Rendani River.
The airport rescue and fire fighting unit was immediately deployed to assist the post-crash evacuation. Due to the steep terrain 155 meters from the end of runway 35, the rescuers had to turn back and use the airport’s main road to reach the aircraft.

At 18:50 the crew contacted Marseilles and requested a heading of 350 degrees to avoid the area of active clouds that the crew had noticed on their weather radar. The controller cleared the flight to climb to 
FL160, at the requested course. The flight was cleared to climb further to FL190 and at 18:55 instructed to turn right to the MOREG reporting point. During the turn towards the reporting point, while the autopilot was connected, the crew saw that they were approaching an active cell. The captain, who was PNF, instructed the copilot to tighten the turn, which reached a 45° bank angle.
At 18:56 Marseille transferred the flight to Geneva Control. It was during this first turn to MOREG that the first burst of hail hit the plane for a duration of one to two seconds. Then a second hailstorm struck the plane, with a duration of 10 to 15 seconds. 
At that moment the captain took control of the aircraft putting the airplane in a 60° bank angle. The plane lost 500 feet altitude.
The crew did not declare an emergency but advised ATC of his intention to turn back to Lyon. The captain asked the flight engineer to depressurize the cabin, which was conducted during descent. There was no rapid depressurization.

Approximately nine minutes before the landing, the co-pilot activated the aircraft radio control of aerodrome lighting (ARCAL) and contacted the approach UNICOM at Bromont. The Bromont Airport dispatcher informed the crew that only the PAPI was operational. A NOTAM had been issued on 17 February 2005, indicating that the runway edge lights would be out of order until 22:00 UTC, 22 February 2005. The PAPI and the approach lights lit up when the co-pilot activated the ARCAL, because their switches had been left on. At approximately 1000 feet (300 m) asl and five miles (8 km) from the threshold, the flight crew had the approach lights and the PAPI in sight. It was not evident whether the PAPI was positioned on the right or the left side of the runway. The airport chart published by Jeppesen indicated ""PAPI L"" (left). In response to a query from the crew, the Bromont dispatcher indicated that the PAPI was on the right side of the runway. From his location facing the aircraft, the PAPI was to the dispatcher's right. The approach was continued visually, keeping to the left of the PAPI. At approximately two miles (3,2 km) from the runway threshold, the co-pilot noticed that the approach lights were at his right. He reported his observation to the captain, who paid little attention to it. Less than two seconds before the crash, the co-pilot asked the captain whether he had the runway in sight. The captain did not reply and continued the descent until the aircraft touched down 300 feet (90 m) to the left of runway 05L, 1800 feet (550 m) beyond the threshold. When the captain realized that he was not on the runway, he applied full power to execute a missed approach; however, the aircraft hit a ditch approximately four feet (1,20 m) deep that was perpendicular to the flight path.

There were no injuries. 
The flight was destined for Atlanta, Georgia. According to the captain, the ramp was covered with snow and ice, and their gate position required a pushback with a nose swing of about 120 degrees. The airplane had an inoperative APU, and he elected to start both engines at the gate prior to pushback because a single engine crossbleed start would require an N1 of 80 percent on the operative engine. After both engines were started, the pushback was initiated. As the tug neared a 90 degree position to the right side of the nose of the airplane, it started to move forward, and then stopped when it struck the tug, after which the captain set the brakes. The captain added that he had not applied the brakes until after the airplane came to rest. 
The tug driver reported that he had already pushed back two airplanes that morning with no problems, and that the initial part of the push was without incident. As the airplane entered an area where the ramp was icy, he turned the nose of the airplane to the west. The nosewheels on the airplane started slipping, and he was unable to communicate this to the cockpit crew. He stopped the tug and the airplane slid into the tug.

Onboard the aircraft were 40 passengers and a crew of 4.
On the two previous flights, there had been problems with extending the flaps before landing, first in Paris and then in Valladolid, where the aircraft had to land with the flaps retracted.
During the ground tests performed by the crew in Valladolid, the flaps extended and retracted normally, and so the captain decided to continue with the flights as scheduled.
During the flight, the crew went over the abnormal procedures to be followed in case of a repeat failure of the flaps system.
After taking off from Valladolid, the flaps were retracted normally and remained retracted during the cruise and descent phases until the initial approach to Barcelona, at which time they failed to extend to the 8-degree position when commanded, resulting in a ""flap fail"" warning on the EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System). The copilot noted the discrepancy between the commanded 8° position on the flaps lever and the 0° indicated position. At that time they were below the clouds and under ATC radar control.
In the zero-flaps configuration, the ILS approach speed, in accordance with the relevant procedure, had to be maintained above 180 kt. ATC cleared them for the runway 25R approach and informed of a moderate intensity crosswind of 14 kt from 320°.
The aircraft descended until it touched down at an IAS of 172 kt, at which time the crew realized they had not lowered the landing gear. After a long slide on the runway, the aircraft stopped 240 m before the end of the runway.
There was no fire, though high temperatures and kerosene leaks were detected. A firefighting vehicle that was on the tarmac immediately reported to the scene, and sprayed the part of the aircraft in contact with the ground with fire retardant foam.

Because the crew misjudged their distance to the runway they ended up being unable to decrease speed and extend flaps to landing configuration. With a high rate of descent the aircraft touched down. On touchdown the airplane bounced twice, the second and last bounce was reported to be more severe than the first one, causing the nose gear to collapse. The hydraulic system sustained damage, causing fluid to leak, which caught fire due to the friction of the aircraft on the runway. The captain applied reverse power and brakes, controlling the aircraft by using rudder inputs. The airplane decelerated with smoke emitting from the forward cargo compartment. After coming to a standstill, the loadmaster opened the airplane door taking the extinguisher, attempting to extinguish the fire. The airport fire truck could not be started, so the fire fighting personnel ran to the airplane carrying portable fire extinguishers. After twenty minutes the truck's battery had been recharged. The fire truck then drove to the scene and extinguished the fire.;09:13;Antonov 72-100;null;Sunday 21 April 2002

All 14 passengers and two crew members were killed. The airplane operated on NOAR Linhas Aéreas Flight 4896 from Recife (REC) to Mossoró (MVF) with an en route stop at Natal (NAT). The airplane had taken off from runway 18 at Recife at 06:51. 
During the takeoff briefing, the captain said that he would consider the possibility of landing on the runway, if a failure occurred after V1 (decision speed), with sufficient runway and the landing gear still not retracted.
He also said that, if a failure occurred after V1 and with the landing gear retracted, he would proceed with the flight, while the copilot would be in charge of monitoring the instruments and complementing the emergency procedures after 400ft AGL. He informed that, in such case, the turns would be made towards the ""good engine"" side.
During the takeoff, three seconds after the captain requested retraction of the landing gear, a sound was heard from the engines.
Despite the captain's request to retract the landing gear, his request was only complied with 50 seconds later, after the fourth time he repeated it.
After verifying the engine failure occurrence, the copilot asked the captain to ""abort takeoff"" three times, adding that the aircraft had lost power. The captain proceeded with the departure, saying that there was not enough space to abort takeoff.
The captain, then, told the copilot to request landing on runway ""thirty"", repeating this request twice, without taking into account that Recife Airport runway has the thresholds 18 and 36. The copilot, however, informed the Tower controller that the aircraft would proceed for a landing on runway 36.
Shortly after this message, the copilot asked the captain to ""lower the aircraft nose"". In his reply, the captain asked the copilot to take it easy, and the copilot agreed: ""I know, we are at 400ft, let's fly!"".
Then, there was a significant change in the cockpit background noise, with the captain telling the copilot to feather the propellers of engine number 1.
The captain told the copilot to call the Tower, and the copilot asked what his message to ATC should be. The captain instructed him to tell ATC that they were in emergency.
The copilot's answer to the captain was: ""We are in emergency. We are cleared to land on runway 36, let's go"".
Then, the alerts ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" and ""Too low, terrain"" were heard several times.
At 06:52:45, the captain asked the copilot to feather the left engine propeller blades, and the copilot answered by saying that the propeller blades had already been feathered.
At 06:52:52, the copilot asked the captain to turn towards the aerodrome. The captain answered that he was already doing so. Shortly after, at 06:53:02, the stall alert went off.
The copilot then said ""eighty-one, lower the nose"", and then the alerts ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" and ""Too low, terrain!"" were heard.
At 06:53:22, the copilot uttered ""one hundred twenty feet"" and then a stall alert was heard.
The copilot asked the captain to 'hold the power', and the captain said that 'it was in full power'.
Then, the copilot asked the captain not to hold the nose too much to keep the aircraft from stalling.
He then asked the captain whether they would land on the beach, and received a firm ""no"" as an answer.
At 06:53:43, the copilot commented to the captain that they were at a hundred twenty feet, and that there was not sufficient height to proceed to the runway, suggesting that they should land on a sand strip on the beach.
The captain replied that he would not land on the beach, and informed that they would land in the ""field"", instead.
At 06:53:56, the copilot radioed: ""NOAR 4-8-9-6 is... it is going to make an emergency landing on the beach...it is not possible to reach the runway... land here in the sand... land in the sand that does not…"".
Then, the stall alert went off.
The captain, anew, told the copilot that they would not land in the sand, and the copilot replied that they would fall on top of the buildings. From this moment on, the stall alert continued being heard for 19 seconds up to the time the stall occurred, occasionally intercalated with the alerts ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" and ""Too low, terrain!""
At 06:54:12, the copilot asked the PIC to ""please"" land on the beach, to which the captain rudely answered that he would not do that.
The copilot insisted, saying that they were not able to reach the runway, and the PIC said: ""It's OK! Leave it to me!""
At 06:54:25, the copilot made a comment to the captain that they were stalling and repeated the comment.
The nose was pitching up until the aircraft stalled, impacting a field close to a road. A fire erupted. The airplane came down in a vacant lot near the beach, located 1700 m from the runway threshold.";06:54;Let L-410UVP-E20;NOAR Linhas Aéreas;Wednesday 13 July 2011

On April 25 they left Verkhnyaya Khava and flew to an area 4 km north of the city for another crop spraying mission. The captain did not judge the wind direction adequately, so the airplane attempted to takeoff from the area with a tailwind component. Direction could not be maintained due to the wind. The pilot did not use the brakes to maintain directional control. The airplane did not achieve the speed necessary to lift off (99 km/h). The pilot pulled on the controls, but could not lift the An-2 off the ground. It ran onto a freshly ploughed field and overturned.

The gross fuel imbalance resulted from an unmonitored transfer of fuel from the right wing and right wing tip tank to the left that was initiated by the crew approximately nine and one-half minutes before impact. As the aircraft approached the point when it would normally transition to a flare, it leveled off and began a climbing turn to the west, toward the tower. It did not touch down prior to the turn, but veered left immediately during the flare, and then rolled back to wings level momentarily as it climbed.
The heavier left wing, and application of power to the right engine for the go-around, caused the aircraft to roll back into a steeper left turn, stayed in a climbing left turn with the bank continuing to increase until il rolled through more than 90 degrees of bank.

Upon takeoff, a flight control system malfunction, the board found, generated directional instability, causing the aircraft's nose to slowly drift from side-to-side or ""rudder-hunt."" This condition, not fully diagnosed by the crew, progressed into a more dangerous oscillatory instability known as a ""Dutch roll."" The board identified that a poor layout of key information in the inflight manual and insufficient crew training contributed to the mishap by detracting from the crew's ability to act on critical information during their troubleshooting to turn off either of two cockpit switches which may have eliminated the malfunction.
Having not recognized the Dutch roll condition, the crew initiated a left turn to remain on-course along the planned route of flight and used a small amount of left rudder to coordinate the turn. The use of rudder, while in a Dutch roll, increased the aircraft's oscillatory instability. The ensuing large side-to-side movements of the aircraft varied the crew member's foot pressure on the rudder pedal which caused inadvertent fluctuations in rudder position. These fluctuating rudder movements, coupled with slight right rudder use while rolling out of the turn, compounded the Dutch roll severity and produced extreme airframe stress that caused the KC-135's tail section to separate from the aircraft. The subsequent, uncontrollable descent resulted in an in-flight explosion.";14:55;Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker;United States Air Force - USAF;Friday 3 May 2013

All seven crew members were killed in the accident.
The accident flight was operated as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to transport military equipment.
The original schedule was for the crew to operate flight NCR510 from Chateauroux, France to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, and then continue to the Dubai World Center at Al Aktoum, UAE. Because no Pakistan over-flight permit was obtained, the flight was re-routed as NCR102 to operate from Camp Bastion to Bagram, refuel, and continue NCR102 from Bagram to Dubai. 
According to the load manifest, while in Camp Bastion, the airplane was loaded by National Air Cargo ground personnel with 94,119 kg of cargo, including 5 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored military vehicles that were loaded on the main deck of the airplane. Two of these vehicles weighed about 12 tons each, and the other three weighed about 18 tons each.
It was the first time National Airlines had transported 18-ton military vehicles when they were loaded on the accident airplane in Camp Bastion.
The airplane departed Camp Bastion at 07:45Z and arrived into Bagram at 09:23Z (13:53 local time). On arrival into Bagram, the crew experienced a brake overheat condition after landing on runway 03. The crew parked the airplane on the Foxtrot ramp and ran a checklist to address the brake temperature indications in the cockpit, and discussed the required cooling time of 1 to 1.5 hours. 

The crew did not take on any additional cargo in Bagram, and only took on fuel for the flight to Dubai. 
At about 14:27 hours local time while the airplane was still on the ramp in Bagram, the captain was made aware of a broken strap found by one of the other crewmembers, and the cockpit crew had a discussion about a possible shift of the cargo load during landing in Bagram.
There was additional discussion on re-securing the load prior to departure.
Flight NCR102 taxied out normally for departure on runway 03 at Bagram at 15:14. After receiving clearance, takeoff was commenced at 15:26. The takeoff roll appeared normal. The airplane rotated normally around the Charlie intersection of the runway. Approximately 9 seconds after the crew called to rotate the airplane, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording, and approximately 3 seconds later the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. According to witnesses and video evidence, after becoming airborne, the airplane continued to pitch up until it appeared to stall, turn to the right, then descended to impact with the ground just beyond the departure end of runway 03 and to the right. 

An investigation of the wreckage revealed at least the aft-most MRAP broke loose of its restraints during takeoff, shifted aft and damaged the FDR/CVR before penetrating the aft pressure bulkhead. The MRAP’s aft movement was determined to have compromised at least Hydraulic Systems #1 and #2 and may have contacted the stabilizer jackscrew assembly.";15:27;Boeing 747-428BCF;National Airlines (National Air Cargo);Monday 29 April 2013

The captain was the pilot flying and the takeoff, climb and cruise portion of the flight was uneventful. Prior to landing, the captain conducted the approach briefing, indicating that they would conduct a visual approach to runway 26, the gusty winds required a wind additive to the approach speed and would go-around if the approach was not stabilized.
On final approach, the local controller cleared the flight to land and reported the winds were 310 degrees at 16 knots. The flight crew stated that at 1000 feet AGL the landing checklist was complete, the airplane was fully configured for landing and the approach speed was set to 132 knots (Vref + 5). 
Recorder data indicated that during the final approach, the autothrottle was disconnected about 800 feet above the ground and the airspeed decreased to as low as 129 knots but did not go below Vref (127 knots). The first officer (FO) stated that he called out the low airspeed and adjusted the target airspeed from 132 to 134 knots. The captain increased power during the approach but the airspeed remained slightly below Vapp until landing. Pitch attitude on final approach was stable at about 5 to 6 degrees nose up. The pitch attitude at touchdown was about 7 degrees and the airplane touched down first on the right main landing gear (MLG) and then on the left MLG. The flight crew stated that they felt that the airplane bounced and both called for a go around simultaneously. About one second after the initial touchdown, the ground spoilers began to deploy, followed by an increase in pitch in the next two seconds from 4.2 degrees to 12.7 degrees. Thrust levers advanced to near maximum thrust about one second after the left MLG touched down and as the ground spoilers were in transit. Pitch attitude continued to increase to more than 14 degrees while the airplane was still on the ground. Neither flight crewmember was aware of a tail strike until the captain discovered damage to the airplane during the post flight inspection.
The tail strike resulted in aft fuselage skin cracks and numerous sheared rivets, internal structural damage to the frames, a cracked support bracket, buckled floor beam, buckled main cargo deck floor panels, and buckled stringers.";20:38;Airbus A300F4-622R;United Parcel Service - UPS;Tuesday 22 March 2011

The aircraft was parked at stand J10 at terminal 2G and was ready for a flight bound for Clermont-Ferrand Airport. The apron management services agent asked the flight to be pushed back facing east.
The crew of the aeroplane parked at J11 then also requested pushback. In order to allow this aeroplane to start its manoeuvre sooner, the apron management services agent then asked the crew of F-HBLF to be towed, with the assistance of a tug, after its pushback, facing south until abeam stand 12 at the end of their pushback. 
During the pushback, the crew of F-HBLF started the airplane's two engines, which stabilised at ground idle. Following the pushback from J10, the airplane was on the axis specified in the documentation.
In order to position the airplane on the centreline of taxiway E7, the tug driver had to make the airplane make a turn of about 90° with a short turn radius. To do this, he positioned his tug at approximately 90° to the airplane axis. When the tug began to pull the aircraft, the safety cotter pins on the tow bar coupling head broke. The coupling head was then only connected to the tow bar by an axle around which it could pivot horizontally.
Under the effect of its inertia and the thrust of the two engines at idle, the aircraft continued to advance in a straight line. When the coupling head reached the stop, the airplane pivoted towards the right and collided with the tug.

The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) positioning flight departed Great Falls International Airport, MT (GTF), at 20:40. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the departure airport and dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport.
The airplane was approximately 42 nautical miles from the tower-controlled destination airport, when the pilot was cleared for the visual approach. The flight did not arrive at the airport and reports were received that it had crashed.
The wreckage was located later that evening approximately 80 feet below the peak of a ridge that rose to an elevation of approximately 5,700 feet. 
The airport is located in a large valley and is surrounded by rising mountainous terrain. At night, clouds and terrain are difficult for pilots to see, and a gradual loss of visual cues can occur as flight is continued toward darker terrain. Additionally, the horizon is less visible and less distinct at night than during the day. Because the pilot was descending the airplane over rural, mountainous terrain that provided few visual ground reference cues, and because the overcast cloud layer would have prevented moonlight from illuminating the terrain, it is likely that the pilot did not see the rising terrain as the airplane continued toward it. The airplane was equipped with an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System; however, impact damage to the unit precluded post accident testing. It is not known how the unit was configured during the flight or what type of alerts the pilot received prior to impact. Post accident examination of the wreckage, to include both engines, did not disclose evidence of a mechanical malfunction prior to impact. Additionally, no evidence was found to suggest an in-flight structural failure.";21:04;Beechcraft 200 Super King Air;Metro Aviation;Tuesday 6 February 2007

About 12,5 km out, the aircraft's rate of descent increased, causing it to descend below the glideslope. The rate of descent was arrested at a height of 170 m, 8 km from the threshold of runway 08L and they continued in level flight. At the Outer Marker (3,5 km from the runway) they should have started their initial approach, but the crew continued level flight thus flying above the glideslope now. With 2,5 km to go the airplane descended slightly at 1-1,5 m/sec. At the Inner Marker the descent rate increased to 2-2,6 m/sec. The crew then probably saw the runway lights below them. The engines were brought back to idle and reverse thrust was applied at a height of 60 m. When it appeared that they would not be able to land given the remaining runway length, reverse thrust was deselected and engine power was increased. At that point the airplane touched down 260 m past the end of the runway. It continued until the right wing struck a concrete building.

There were no injuries. The aircraft was operated by America West Airlines as flight 2747, a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight, destined for Columbus, Ohio. 
According to the operator, the pilot reported there had been an abnormal vibration as the aircraft accelerated through takeoff rotation speed (Vr). Several passengers pressed their flight attendant call buttons and alerted the flight attendants who, in turn, reported the cowling separation to the cockpit crew. The return for landing at the departure airport at 13:31 was unremarkable. The aircraft was taxied to the terminal gate and the passengers deplaned normally.

Postflight inspection revealed that the outboard, forward cowl door on the left (number 1) engine had separated from the engine nacelle. There was a 10-inch cut through the landing gear (strut) door and there were 3 holes in the lower surface of the left horizontal stabilizer, each approximately 2 inches wide and 8 inches long. The cowling door hold-open rod penetrated the lower skin and aft spar web of the horizontal stabilizer. No damage was observed on the wing or wing flap. The opposite (inboard) cowl door and the ""bull nose,"" where the two doors hinge at the 12 o'clock position, were damaged but remained attached to the nacelle. The cowl door over-center type latches on the inboard door were found latched, however, the hooks were intact and undamaged. Similarly, the latch receptacles on the outboard door were visibly undamaged. The latches were painted red.
The operator reported that the aircraft remained overnight in Las Vegas and an ""RON-check"" (Remain Over Night) had been performed during hours of darkness. The RON-check required that the cowling doors be opened; however, the mechanic performing the work reported that the cowl doors were closed and re-latched about 05:30 - 06:00 during hours of daylight.

There were 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.
The Boeing 777-2H6ER took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport's runway 32R at 00:41. At 00:42 the flight was cleared to climb to FL180 and was issued a direct track by Lumpur Approach to the IGARI waypoint. MH370 was then transferred to Lumpur Radar and was cleared to climb to FL250. At 00:50 the flight was further cleared to the planned cruising altitude of FL350. MH370 reported maintaining FL350 at 01:07. Last radio contact was at 01:19 when the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller instructed the flight to contact the radio frequency of Ho Chi Minh Air Traffic Control Centre, Vietnam: ""Malaysian Three Seven Zero contact Ho Chi Minh 120 decimal 9 Good Night"". One of the flight crew members replied: ""Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero."" 
At 01:21 MH370 was observed on the radar screen of the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller as it passed over waypoint IGARI. Nine seconds later the radar label for MH370 disappeared from the radar screen. The transponder was switched off. 
At 01:38 Ho Chi Minh ATCC contacted Kuala Lumpur ATCC on the whereabouts of MH370. Kuala Lumpur ATCC contacted the airline's operations centre, Singapore ACC, Hong Kong ACC, and Phnom Penh ACC, failing to establish the location of MH370.
Meanwhile, the airplane flew in a westerly direction back over peninsular Malaysia before turning northwest. Primary radar data showed that the aircraft tracked along the Malacca Strait. During this time the aircraft passed close to waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM and possibly IGOGU along a section of airway N571. The final primary radar fix occurred at 02:22.
From then on seven handshakes between the aircraft's SATCOM system and the Inmarsat ground station were recorded. Last satellite data was recorded at 08:11 Malaysian time.

Initially search efforts focused on the South China Sea area. On 24 March 2014 further analysis of the Inmarsat satellite data indicated that MH370 flew south and ended its flight in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. 
A surface search was conducted of probable impact areas along an arc, identified by calculations based on Inmarsat data. The search was carried out from 18 March - 28 April 2014. This search effort was undertaken by an international fleet of aircraft and ships with the search areas over this time progressing generally from an initial southwest location along the arc in a north-easterly direction. No debris associated with MH370 was identified either from the surface search, acoustic search or from the ocean floor search in the vicinity of acoustic detections, which were initially believed to have been from the pingers on the flight recorders. The ocean floor search was completed on 28 May 2014.
On June 26 the ATSB published a new search area based on refinements to the analysis of both the flight and satellite data. The priority area of approximately 60,000 km2 extends along the arc for 650 km in a northeast direction from Broken Ridge, an underwater ridge. The width of the priority search area is 93 km.

On July 29, 2015 a flapperon washed ashore on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. On August 5 it was established to have been from MH370.";ca 08:11;Boeing 777-2H6ER;Malaysia Airlines;Saturday 8 March 2014

The airplane was being operated as an instrument (IFR) cross-country cargo flight when the accident occurred. The flight originated at the Fairbanks International Airport, Alaska, about 12:47.
The captain indicated he flew over runway 30 to inspect the runway, and observe the wind sock, which is located at the north end of the runway. The wind direction from the wind sock, a comparison of the airplane's airspeed, and ground speed indication from a global positioning system receiver (GPS), revealed variable wind conditions that were less than 10 knots. The captain decided to land toward the north, and planned to touch down in the first few hundred feet of the approach end of runway 30. During the landing flair, the airplane floated slightly, and then touched down about 1,200 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. After touch down, the captain lowered the nose of the airplane, and brought the engines into reverse. As the airplane decelerated, it drifted slightly to the left, but the captain indicated he did not notice any collision with any objects. After the airplane was parked, the crew noticed damage to the leading edge of the left wing, about 18 inches inboard from the tip.

An inspection of the leading edge revealed a collision with about a 3 inch diameter tree. The wing received aft crushing, damage to a wing nose rib, and slight denting of the wing spar web.

The flight departed Canberra, Australia at 16:12 local time with the first officer as the pilot flying. A steeper-than-usual climb was carried out to reduce exposure to turbulence. However, other than the expected turbulence during the first 1,500 ft, there was nothing significant during the climb to FL170.
During cruise, the crew conducted a routine brief for the anticipated arrival to runway 16R, which was expected to be standard except for commencement of descent 5 NM (9 km) earlier than normal to compensate for a tailwind. The captain noted the need to be cognizant of managing airspeed during the descent as the anticipated decreasing tailwind would result in a temporary increase in the indicated airspeed.
The first officer commenced descent into Sydney with the autopilot engaged in vertical speed mode and a target airspeed of 235 kt (15 kt less than the maximum operating speed of 250 kt). The descent was reported to have been initially stable and smooth.
On first contact with Sydney Approach the crew were assigned runway 16L. This was different to the expected runway and required the crew to re-brief the approach and change the instrument approach diagrams and navigational aid frequencies.
Passing 8,500 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), the crew noticed a rapid airspeed increase. The first officer reported that the airspeed trend indicator was 'off the chart', indicating a very rapid increase in airspeed. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the aircraft's nose to control the speed. The first officer expected that, in combination, the pitch correction and power reduction would be sufficient to arrest the speed trend.
The first officer reported that the aircraft felt 'heavy', as was normal for this aircraft at that speed, requiring two hands on the controls to move from the then -4° pitch angle. 
The captain reported being unsure if the first officer's control inputs would be sufficient to avoid exceeding the maximum operating speed limitation, so put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further.
Shortly after, with both flight crew making simultaneous nose up pitch inputs on the controls, the aircraft rapidly pitched up with an associated increase in the g load. The first officer responded by immediately reversing the control input to nose down. Both flight crew noticed that the controls suddenly felt different and 'spongy'. At about the same time, aural and visual cockpit warnings activated. The crew verified that the aircraft was under control at a stable attitude and speed, observing that it was level or in a slight descent at an airspeed of about 230 kt.
One of the cockpit warnings was 'pitch disconnect', indicating that the left and right elevator control systems had uncoupled from each other. This allowed for independent movement of the left and right elevators via the captain's and first officer's control columns respectively.
The crew consulted the pitch disconnect checklist and worked to identify which control column was free and working normally. After determining that both controls were free, it was decided that the captain would be pilot flying for the remainder of the approach and landing at Sydney Airport. The aerodynamic loads generated during the pitch disconnect resulted in serious injury to the senior cabin crew member and significant damage to the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser. Although the aircraft was inspected after the pitch disconnect, the damage was not identified until 25 February 2014.

On 15 June 2016 the ATSB released an interim investigation report that contained the following safety issue:
- Inadvertent application of opposing pitch control inputs by flight crew can activate the pitch uncoupling mechanism which, in certain high-energy situations, can result in catastrophic damage to the aircraft structure before crews are able to react. 

While this issue focused on the potential for catastrophic damage during inadvertent activation of the pitch uncoupling mechanism (PUM) from opposing dual control inputs, additional investigation identified that the inherent behaviour of the elevator control system design could potentially result in an ultimate load exceedance from the deliberate activation of the PUM to overcome a jam. Based on the results of this additional investigation, the ATSB made the following finding on May 5, 2017:
- The aircraft manufacturer did not account for the transient elevator deflections that occur as a result of the system flexibility and control column input during a pitch disconnect event at all speeds within the flight envelope. As such, there is no assurance that the aircraft has sufficient strength to withstand the loads resulting from a pitch disconnect.";16:40;ATR 72-212A (ATR-72-600);Virgin Australia Regional;Thursday 20 February 2014

The airplane sustained substantial damage. The 2 pilots, 1 flight attendant, and 14 passengers were not injured. 
According to the pilots, about 2,000 feet mean sea level (msl) during the initial climb, a bang sound was heard; the airplane yawed right, and the right propeller auto feathered. Flames were observed by passengers and the cabin attendant emanating from the right engine. The crew performed the engine shutdown and fire check lists, and turned off the fuel within 1 minute of the mishap. 
The cockpit crew extinguished the fire using both of the airplane's fire bottles. The cockpit crew then observed that hydraulic and rudder lights on the master alert panel were illuminated, along with the associated hydraulic lights on the overhead panel, which indicated loss of both hydraulic systems.
The crew diverted to Naval Air Station (NAS) Miramar, extended the landing gear manually, and accomplished a landing without flaps. The captain indicated that he landed within the first 2,000 feet of runway 24R. He was unable to use single engine reverse thrust to decelerate because of the loss of nose wheel steering. Additionally, the captain attempted to use the airplane's primary and emergency brakes; however, hydraulic pressure was also lost to these systems.

The crew suffered no significant injuries.
The instructor and pilot were both assigned to the U.S. Air Force 86th Flying Training Squadron, 47th Flying Training Wing, Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas.
The accident occurred while the crew was flying a Mission Qualification Training (MQT) flight to familiarize the pilot, as a new instructor, with local area mission procedures.
The crew was on their second flight of the day. They took off from runway 17R with the intent to fly the Localizer Approach (a non-precision approach) to runway 26, circle to runway 17R, and stay in the pattern for more approaches. The crew was aware of rainshowers in the vicinity of the airport, gusty surface winds, blowing dust, and strong winds at altitude, approximately 35-40 knots. During the circling approach, the crew elected to go-around because of the winds. As the crew turned and aligned to final approach, the airplane experienced a rapid nose down change in its pitch, and the crew felt a sinking sensation. The crew set the throttles at their maximum performance in order to gain altitude. The airplane did not respond but kept descending. The crew applied stall recovery procedures and continued to maneuver the jet toward runway 17R. The crew reported, ""Major gust, major gust"" on the radio to the tower just prior to impact. The airplane hit the ground, sheared off its nose landing gear, and, after traveling some distance, came to rest on its main landing gear with its nose on the ground.";21:44;Beechcraft T-1A Jayhawk;United States Air Force - USAF;Wednesday 21 May 2008

On board the aircraft, a DHC-8-103 with registration LN-WIK, were a crew of two pilots and one cabin attendant, 26 passengers and one passive cabin attendant. 
During the approach to Hammerfest the crew was informed about variable and occasional gusty wind from south-east. The wind direction favoured runway 23 and the crew planned the landing accordingly. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). The copilot was newly hired and was flying under supervision. The crew was kept updated on the wind conditions by the AFIS operator, and at times the gusty wind conditions favoured runway 05. The copilot left the control to the commander who continued the approach to runway 05. Just before landing the wind direction veered to the right and increased in strength, resulting in a significant tail wind component. This resulted in a marked increase in the descent rate which the commander tried to stop by advancing to full power. However, the altitude was too low and the airplane touched down hard just inside the runway edge on runway 05. At touch down the right main landing gear leg failed. The airplane slid on the belly, right partly retracted main wheel and wing tip for some 650 m, and stopped just after the second (TWY B) turnoff to the apron. The fire and rescue vehicles were quickly at the scene and sprayed foam on the plane to prevent fire. The cabin attendant calmed the passengers who wanted to get out of the plane quickly due to smoke and burned smell in the cabin. It took 33 seconds from the commander's order to evacuate until this was actually initiated. The delay was mainly caused by the fact that the order did not get through the cabin’s Public Address (PA) system.
The investigations show that Widerøe permitted landings in up to the maximum demonstrated cross wind component of 36 kt and in up to 10 kt tail wind during short field operations.";14:36;de Havilland Canada DHC-8-103;Widerøes Flyveselskap;Sunday 1 May 2005

The pilot told the hijacker that Tehran’s airport was closed and persuaded him to allow the plane to land at Diyarbakir Airport in Turkey for refueling. Shortly after the plane landed, 20 passengers were released by the hijacker, but Turkish officials refused to refuel the plane. The hijacker then demanded a separate plane to fly him and seven hostages--the pilot, copilot, and five passengers--to Tehran. As Turkish security forces were preparing to assault the plane, several passengers overpowered the hijacker and he was taken into custody. No explosives or weapons were found on the plane, and no one was injured. The hijacker’s motive is unknown, but he reportedly said that he was protesting the oppression of Muslims in Algeria.

There were no injuries among the 142 passengers and six crew members.
The aircraft was on a scheduled flight to London-Luton Airport (LTN), from Faro Airport (FAO) Portugal. The pilot flying (PF) was a captain-under-training, occupying the left seat; the right seat was occupied by a training captain, who was the commander of the aircraft. 
The aircraft was given an early radar vector towards the final approach track to runway 26 and the PF increased the rate of descent to close the correct descent profile from above. 
The aircraft was then allocated a heading of 220°M, cleared to intercept the localiser and, once established, to descend on the glidepath. The PF realised that the aircraft would be high and configured the aircraft with flap 2 and the landing gear down, to capture the 3° glideslope from above. He armed the localiser mode and then attempted to arm the approach mode but inadvertently selected the EXPED pushbutton. The expedite climb mode engaged but, to prevent a climb or any mode confusion and to regain the correct profile, the PF disconnected the autopilot and the autothrust. The aircraft passed through the localiser and ATC issued a revised heading to enable the aircraft to intercept from the south. 
The PF decided to continue flying the approach manually and the aircraft was established on the localiser at 5.5 nm. It was configured for landing, with full flap, at 5 nm. Landing clearance was issued, with a reported surface wind of 320°/15 kt. A subsequent wind check of 320°/16 kt was broadcast three minutes before touchdown. The wind conditions were gusty and gave rise to some turbulence on the approach. 
Stabilised approach criteria were met at 1,000 ft and 500 ft radio altitude (RA). The VAPP (final approach) speed was 129 kt and at 50 ft RA the approach remained stable. Just below 50 ft there was a small nose-up pitch input followed by two nose-down inputs and, below 50 ft, the flight data indicated an increasing rate of descent from about 600 fpm to about 850 fpm. The data also showed that, below 100 ft RA, there were some left and right roll control inputs. 
Below 30 ft, over the runway, both pilots sensed that the aircraft was sinking rapidly and both initiated a TOGA 10 go-around. The PF momentarily retarded the thrust levers to idle before advancing them to the TOGA (Takeoff and Go-around) position. At the same time, he made a full forward sidestick input, within one second, which was then rapidly reversed to full aft sidestick. As the PF made the forward sidestick input, the commander initiated an aft sidestick input which reached the full aft position within one second. 
He followed through the PF, pushing the thrust levers fully forward and announced ""I HAVE CONTROL"". The aircraft made firm contact with the runway at 2.99g and a 12.5 ft/sec rate of descent. It touched down on all three landing gear legs simultaneously, before lifting off and starting to climb. During this phase the PF relinquished control and reverted to the PNF role.
The commander remained as the PF, completed the go-around and subsequently carried out an uneventful landing on the same runway. There were no reported injuries.";13:59;Airbus A319-111;easyJet;Tuesday 14 February 2012

Estimated flying time was 1 hour and 29 minutes. The copilot was Pilot Flying.
Weather at the destination, Oviedo-Asturias Airport, was poor with rain, fog and a cloud base of 300 ft. The flight crew decided to hold at FL100 over the Asturias VOR. The captain assumed the role of Pilot Flying at this time.
Once the weather improved, approaches to runway 29 resumed. Two aircraft landed before flight JK5811 without reporting any problems. Since the cloud base was between 200 and 400 ft, the flight was force to make an ILS approach to runway 29, which meant a landing with a tail wind as winds were reported from 050° at 10 kt with gusts to 18 kt. The tail wind component was calculated to be 5-9,5 knots and the aircraft's tail wind limit was 10 knots.
When the aircraft was at 270 ft, the crew reported runway in sight. Nine seconds later and twelve seconds before touchdown, the captain disconnected the autopilot. The autothrottle system remained active. Descent rate fluctuated, at times reaching 1000 ft/min.
The pilot stated that at about 50 ft he observed an uncommanded descent of the aircraft and tried to compensate by increasing the engine thrust. On touchdown the vertical acceleration reached 4.11g. The aircraft bounced and touched down again, with one of the wheels hitting a runway edge light on the right hand side. Spoilers then extended and the thrust reversers were activated by the crew. The aircraft decellerated normally and taxied to the platform. Substantial damage to the airframe was noted.

The airplane was being controlled by the autopilot at about 18,000 feet when they encountered instrument meteorological conditions that rapidly led to the windscreen being covered by a layer of ice. The crew turned ice protection systems on and the ice on the windshield was cleared. The first officer observed ice on the right wing's boots and the right prop's spinner that extended farther back than he had previously experienced. The first officer then switched the ice protection systems to their highest settings. De airspeed then decreased from 1750 to 160 kts.The captain disconnected the autopilot, applied power, and initiated nose down pitch inputs to arrest the airspeed loss. They indicated that these actions were unsuccessful and the speed further deteriorated to about 130 knots at which point the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left, and then back to near level. In the next 24 seconds, the airplane again rolled about 110 degrees to the left, back to level, then about 120 degrees to the right, back to level, and then rolled 360 degrees to the right, back to near wings level. Since the crew reported trouble with the flight attitude instruments, the roll angles recorded on the FDR are being further investigated. The maximum nose down pitch attitude was 60 degrees, the maximum recorded airspeed was about 240 kias, and maximum vertical acceleration during recovery was about +3.6 g.

The scheduled domestic passenger flight from Worland, Wyoming, to Laramie was operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The captain, first officer and 9 passengers on board were not injured. The flight originated at 15:33.
The captain reported he had planned a visual straight-in approach to runway 12. He said the approach and landing was to be performed based on a landing weight of 13,847 pounds with wing flaps at 35 degrees, an approach speed of 121 knots, and a reference of final approach to landing speed (Vref) of 111 knots. The captain said that on short final, the speed was 125 knots and that they were ""one dot high"" on the approach. He said that on rounding out, he reduced power and placed both hands on the control yoke to have better control of the airplane as there had been some light turbulence. He said this resulted in some excessive floating, though the airplane did touch down softly on the right main tire approximately 2,500 feet down from the runway threshold. The captain said the airplane bounced slightly back into the air. The captain flew the airplane back onto the ground touching both main tires down approximately 1,000 feet further down the runway and just as the airplane passed the intersection of runway 3-21. 
In attempt to avoid an overrun, the captain steered the plane onto the last taxiway but the aircraft began to skid. The captain said that at that point it was apparent that the airplane was going to go off the end of the runway. The captain said he wanted to have as much control as possible so as to not hit anything. He was successful in missing the lights, but was unable to avoid striking an orange control box with the right propeller.
An examination of the airplane showed that one of the four blades on the right propeller had broken torsionally at the spinner/hub. Two other propeller blades showed tip damage. The right side of the fuselage, abeam the right propeller arc, showed a 17-inch long (approximate to the lateral axis), 11-inch wide (approximate to the longitudinal axis) triangular-shaped gash in the outer skin that penetrated into the inner fuselage structure through into the cabin. Insulation and coating between the outer skin and pressure vessel were torn and displaced. The heating vent and cabin wall molding along the floor at the base of seat 1C was pushed inward approximately 8 inches.";16:20;Beechcraft 1900D;Great Lakes Airlines;Wednesday 20 June 2007

The takeoff was planned as a reduced-power takeoff and the first officer was the handling pilot for the departure. At 22:31:53, the captain called for the first officer to rotate. The first officer attempted to rotate the aircraft, but it did not respond immediately with a nose-up pitch. The captain again called 'rotate' and the first officer applied a greater nose-up command. The nose of the aircraft was raised and the tail made contact with the runway surface, but the aircraft did not begin to climb. The captain then selected TOGA on the thrust levers, the engines responded immediately, and the aircraft commenced a climb.
The crew notified air traffic control of the tail strike and that they would be returning to Melbourne. While reviewing the aircraft’s performance documentation in preparation for landing, the crew noticed that a takeoff weight, which was 100 tonnes below the actual takeoff weight of the aircraft, had inadvertently been used when completing the takeoff performance calculation. The result of that incorrect takeoff weight was to produce a thrust setting and takeoff reference speeds that were lower than those required for the actual aircraft weight.
The aircraft subsequently landed at Melbourne with no reported injuries. The tail strike resulted in substantial damage to the tail of the aircraft and damaged some airport lighting and the instrument landing system.
As a result of the accident, the aircraft operator has advised the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that it is reviewing a number of procedures including human factors involved in takeoff performance data entry.";22:32;Airbus A340-541;Emirates;Friday 20 March 2009

The airplane carried 19 passengers and six crew members. All on board were killed in the accident.
The airplane operated on Merpati flight MZ8968 from Sorong (SOQ) to Kaimana (KNG), Nabire (NBX), and Biak (BIK). The flight took off from Sorong at 12:50 for the one hour and four minutes flight to Kaimana. Cruising altitude was 15.500 feet and weather forecast for Kaimana indicated rain with a visibility of 8 km, half of the sky covered with clouds with cloud base at 1400 ft, winds from the southeast at 6 mph (5.2 kts) and temperature of 29°C. 
At 13:25 the crew received updated weather information, indicating that visibility had decreased to 3-8 km, with cumulonimbus clouds at 1500 ft.
At about 13:37, MZ 8968 reported at 7 nautical miles from the airport, descending through an altitude of 8000 ft. 
Five minutes later the Kaimana AFIS (Aerodrome Flight Information Service) officer informed the crew that it was still raining at the airport and the ground visibility was 2 kilometers.
During the approach to Kaimana, the flight crew flew to the south of the airport in an attempt to make a visual approach. The auto-pilot was disengaged at 960 feet pressure altitude. At 376 feet pressure altitude, the crew decided to discontinue the approach and climbed, turning to the left. Engine power was increased and flaps were retracted from 15 to 5 and subsequently to 0 degrees. The landing gear was also retracted. The aircraft rolled to the left with a bank angle of 11° and continuously increased up to 38°. The rate of descend increased significantly up to about 3000 feet per minute and the airplane finally impacted into the shallow sea.

Kaimana Airport has a single runway, 01/19 (asphalt, length 5249 feet / 1600 m) which runs parallel to the coast with the sea to the west and mountains to the east. The airplane crashed into the sea about 800 m southwest of the runway 01 threshold and 550 m from the beach. It broke up and sank to a depth of about 15 metres.
The airplane had been manufacturer in 2008. It was stored at the factory in Xian until it was delivered to Merpati in December 2010.";14:05;Xian MA60;Merpati Nusantara Airlines;Saturday 7 May 2011

Three crew members and six passengers were on board the airplane.
At 07:20 UTC the airplane reached cruise level FL340. After entering Indian airspace (Mumbai FIR) the aircraft was cleared to fly to reporting point KITAL via route L894. At approximately 08:18 UTC the co-pilot radioed reaching reporting point GOLEM.
At 06:55 UTC an Airbus A380-861 (A6-EUL) had taken off at Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates, for flight EK412 to Sydney, Australia. The aircraft flew at FL350 with a southern heading.
At 08:38:07 UTC the A380 had passed the Challenger overhead with a vertical distance of 1,000 ft.
At 08:38:54 UTC the Challenger, with engaged autopilot, began to slightly roll right. At the same time a counter-rotating aileron deflection was recorded and fluctuation of the vertical acceleration began. 
In the subsequent approximately 10 seconds the airplane had a right bank angle of 4° to 6°. At 08:39:03 UTC the right bank angle began to increase. Within one second the bank angle increased to 42° to the right. At the same time the aileron deflection to the left increased to 20° and the vertical acceleration to 1.6 g. In the following second vertical acceleration changed to -3.2 g.
At 08:39:04 UTC a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g to the right was recorded. The pitch angle changed from about 3° to about 1°, then within one second increased to 9° and decreased again in the following second to -20°. At the same time the FDR recorded a rudder deflection to the left reaching 11.2° after about two seconds whereas the bank angle changed from 42° right to 31° left.
Between 08:39:05 UTC and 08:39:10 UTC Indicated Airspeed (in knots) changed from approximately 277 KIAS to 248 KIAS. The N1 of the left engine of 95% began to decrease.
The lateral acceleration then reached 0.94 g left, the autopilot disengaged, and a master warning, lasting seven seconds, was recorded.
Both pilots had actuated the aileron to the right in order to stop the rolling motion. But the airplane had continued to roll to the left thereby completing several rotations. Subsequently both Inertial Reference Systems (IRS), the Flight Management System (FMS), and the attitude indication failed.
Between 08:39:09 UTC and 08:39:41 UTC the FDR recorded a loss of altitude of approximately 8,700 ft. Large control surface deflections and acceleration were recorded. The speed increased and at 08:39:31 UTC reached approximately 330 KIAS. At 08:39:30 UTC the spoilers extended and 13 seconds later were retracted again. The N1 of the left engine had decreased to approximately 40% when the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) began to increase and nine seconds later had reached 850°. The left engine was shut off.
At about 08:56 UTC the Pilot in Command (PIC) informed the air traffic controller in Mumbai of the occurrence, declared emergency, and reported their position, altitude and their intention to fly via KITAL to Oman.
At about 09:15 UTC the crew restarted the left engine. Subsequently the airplane climbed to FL250. At about 09:56 UTC the autopilot was re-engaged.
At 11:05 UTC the Challenger landed at Muscat Airport.
The A380 continued the flight to Sydney and landed there at 19:58 UTC.

The airplane departed with the thrust reverser of engine no. 1 inoperative. 
At 19:20, PR137 called Bacolod Approach Control and reported passing FL260 and 55 DME to Bacolod . The crew then requested landing instructions and was instructed to descend to FL90 after passing Iloilo and descend to 3,000 ft for a VOR runway 04 approach. Wind was 030° at 08 kts, altimeter 1014 mbs, transition level at FL60 and temperature at 28°C. At 19:28, the flight requested to intercept the final approach to runway 04 and Approach Control replied ""PR 137 visual approach on final"". At 19:37, Bacolod Tower cleared the flight to land at runway 04 and the clearance was acknowledged by the pilot.
The approach was flown with the Autothrust system was engaged in SPEED mode. The thrust lever of engine no.1 was left in Climb detent. Upon touchdown the first officer called out ""no spoilers, no reverse, no decel"". Engine no.2 was set to full reverse thrust after touchdown, but the engine no .1 thrust lever was not retarded to idle and remained in the climb power position. Consequently, the spoilers did not deploy. 
Because one engine was set to reverse, the autothrust system automatically disengaged. With the autothrust disengaged, no. 1 engine thrust increased to climb thrust. Due to the asymmetrical thrust condition, the A320 ran off the right side of the runway. At this speed, rudder and nosewheel steering are ineffective. Engine no.2 was moved out of reverse up to more than 70 percent N1 and the airplane swerved back onto the runway. The A320 continued past the runway end.

The aircraft was cleared for the ILS/DME procedure for runway 28 and the crew requested the QFE which was 980 hPa. The decision height for the approach was 400 feet. At 1918:11 the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. When the aircraft intercepted the glidepath, the flaps were set to 15° correctly configuring the aircraft for the approach. The handling pilot recalled that initially the rate of descent was slightly higher than the expected 650 ft/min leading him to suspect the presence of a tailwind, however, the rate of descent returned to a more normal value when approximately 4 nm from the runway. The propellers were set to the maximum rpm at 1,200 feet agl. When the crew reported that they were inside 4 nm they were cleared to land and passed the surface wind, which was variable at 2 kt; they were also warned that the runway surface was wet. Both pilots saw the runway lights when approaching 400 feet agl; the flaps were selected to 30° and confirmed at that position. Both pilots believed that the airspeed was satisfactory but, as the commander checked back on the control column for the landing, the rate of descent increased noticeably and the aircraft landed firmly. Both pilots believed that the power levers were in the flight idle position and neither was aware of any unusual control inputs during the landing flare. The aircraft bounced before hitting the ground again, this time with the nose wheel first, before bouncing once more.

Due to these changes in vertical acceleration, the captain felt that the aircraft had bounced and was floating, although this was not the case. At this time the speed brakes had activated and the reverse thrust was being applied, but the captain did not notice this. The captain diverted his attention to look outside of the aircraft to confirm its attitude, and then judged to make a go-around. When he noticed that the reversers had been activated, he still decided to continue the go around, although the AOM calls for a full stop landing when reversers have been activated. The captain called for a go around three times but the TO/GA switch could not be activated by the co-pilot because the reversers were selected. The captain then called ""I have control"" and took over controls. All the time the airplane had been rolling on the runway in a nose up attitude, causing a tailstrike.

The Sabreliner was inactive since October 2007, due to extensive maintenance to repair corrosion. The pilot and co-pilot were assigned by the operator to move the airplane to its home base at Hernando County Airport (BKV), Brooksville, Florida.
The maintenance facility released the Sabreliner to the pilots on February 1. The Sabreliner was located on the maintenance facility ramp in the northwest corner of Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport. The pilot and copilot boarded the airplane, started the APU, and started both engines.
About 15:40, the Sabreliner began to taxi out, and contacted the FXE ATCT ground controller to coordinate maneuvering around a Cessna Caravan that was headed in the opposite direction on the same ramp. The ground controller replied ""...don't have you in sight if you guys are in the foxtrot one ramp that is uncontrolled."" The accident crew responded that they were aware of that, but that they wanted to ""get out of the way"" of the Caravan. Ground control then asked for the accident crew's intentions, and at 15:42:04, the accident crew replied ""taxi out for departure and I'll get the clearance as soon as I get clear of the Caravan.""

The airplane became airborne and climbed to an altitude of 20 to 30 feet above the runway. The captain reduced the power on both engines and the airplane settled to the runway, striking the tail. The airplane traveled approximately 700 feet off the end of the runway where it came to rest in the muddy terrain. An emergency evacuation was performed during which the L2 evacuation slide did not deploy. During the investigation, NTSB determined that the airplane was loaded so that its center of gravity (CG), although within limits, was in the aft region of the permissible range. Further, the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim for the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) at -1.7°UP (airplane nose up). This setting resulted in a pitch-up trim condition. The proper trim setting, 1.7°DN (airplane nose down), would have resulted in a correct trim condition for the way the airplane was loaded.

The LKG Tactical Landing Zone (TLZ) is 6800ft long by 150ft wide with a surface of compacted sand and gravel located on the south side of LKG town. The TLZ is used by UK forces and other agencies including the UN and Red Cross.
The aircraft took off at 08:50 UTC from Kabul International Airport (KBL) to fly a routine logistics sortie to deliver cargo and personnel to LKG TLZ. After an uneventful medium level transit the aircraft landed at LKG at 10:20 UTC. Using a standard tactical landing technique the aircraft touched down some 500ft in from the runway threshold, reverse thrust was selected and speed reduced without the need for wheel braking.
After 3 seconds, as the speed was nearing 70 kts there was a loud bang from the port side of the aircraft in the vicinity of the port main landing gear, the force of which was felt throughout the aircraft. At the same time the flight deck crew saw tyre debris flying up in front of the aircraft and then became aware of structural damage to the number 2 engine. The captain ordered the Emergency Engine Shutdown Drill (EESD) on the number 2 engine. He maintained directional control with nosewheel steering. Immediately after the shutdown of number 2 engine crew members observed a large amount of fuel leaking from the port wing area in the vicinity of the external tank pylon and that there was a fire in the vicinity of No.1 engine. The captain ordered the shut down of the No.1 engine using the EESD. Whilst this drill was carried out crew members observed that the fire was spreading across the whole wing. Realising the severity of the situation the captain brought the aircraft to a halt near the northern end of the landing zone some 6400ft from the touchdown point. He ordered the passengers and crew to immediately carry out the Emergency Evacuation Drill.

The airplane contacted Narita Tower at 06:41 and received a landing clearance for runway 34L. Wind information passed on to the crew indicated gusting winds. As the airplane was probably flying through rough air, the autopilot and autothrottle had difficulties to control airspeed and attitude. 
At 06:47:40 the CAWS announced 500 ft. The calibrated airspeed (CAS) was frequently fluctuating and at this moment the CAS was about 179 kts. The range of CAS fluctuation was from 152 to 180 kt which was 12 kts slower and 16 kts faster than the selected approach speed of 164 kts. This exceeded the stabilized approach criteria. The pilot monitoring called ""stabilize"" and most likely let the pilot flying continue approaching, disregarding airspeed deviation of more than Vapp plus 10 kt. 
The autopilot was disconnected at 198 ft radio altitude, while the autothrottle remained engaged. The pitch angle then decreased from 1.4° while the CAS was 178.5 kts. The airplane was almost on the glide slope at this point. Just after the autopilot was disconnected, the pitch angle temporarily decreased as low as 0.4° but it increased to 3.5° by the time the airplane descended to 92 ft. 
In the meantime, the CAS decreased as low as 154 ft (Vapp minus 10 kt) and the airplane descended about half a dot below the glide slope. It is highly probable that this large speed decrease stemmed from the inability of the autothrottle system to counteract the large wind velocity change (decreasing head wind component) during the descent and the fact that the thrust was kept at idle during the increment of the pitch angle to 3.5°. The increased pitch angle and corresponding column input indicates the pilot flying's intention to correct the lowered flight path. 
The CAS increased to 161 kt from 154 kt, but it was still slower than Vapp (164 kt). The deviation from the glide slope had increased to -1.11 dot. 
The pilot flying began correcting the heading to correct for the cross wind component from the left and align the longitudinal axis with the runway centerline. 
When the radio altimeter indicated about 48 ft, the pitch angle was 1.1° and a sink rate was about 13 fps. The autothrottle was engaged, and the thrust levers were in the retard mode which started to automatically decrease the thrust below 50 ft, reaching idle when descending through 20 ft. 
The pilot flying initiated the flare later than usual at 20 ft, not at 30 ft. Rapid and large column input during flare indicates the pilot's recognition of the late flare. The pitch angle remained 1.1° (about 2° lower than usual) until the flare, and the pitch angle temporarily decreased to 0.7° (below 20 ft) followed by the quick increment of the pitch angle to 4.6° in 2 seconds before touchdown. 
The control column was pushed largely forward (-4.9°) just before the touchdown. The airplane consequently experienced a large sink rate upon the first touchdown as high as 7 fps. Vertical acceleration spiked to 1.63 G and the airplane bounced.
The forward control column input just before and during the touchdown most likely resulted in the rapid derotation from 4.6° at the first touchdown to below zero in 1.5 seconds. The decreasing pitch angle, with the main landing gear still in the air, may have made it difficult for the pilot flying to recognize the need for bounce recovery due to his lowering eye point.
It may be possible that he didn't realize the airplane had bounced.
The airplane then touched down on the nose landing gear with a pitch angle of -1.8°, followed later by the main landing gear.
After touchdown the nosegear rebounded off quickly increasing the pitch angle, leading to increased lift, resulting in a high bounce to 16 ft above the runway. 
The nose dropped again and the airplane landed on the nosegear followed by the main landing gears. As the airplane was rolling to the left, the left main gear first touched down, followed by the center landing gear and the right main gear. The recorded vertical acceleration at this time was 3.06 G. The airplane sink rate was estimated to be 21.5 fps at the third touchdown. It is highly probable that the airplane‘s kinetic energies at the third touchdown exceeded the certification requirements by almost seven times. 
The left wing attachment point to the fuselage fractured. The fuselage rolled to the left with the lift generated by the right wing and a fire erupted. The airplane rolled inverted and was consumed by fire.";06:49;McDonnell Douglas MD-11F;FedEx Express;Monday 23 March 2009

The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying, and the copilot was the support/monitoring pilot.
The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions.
At 07:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. As the aircraft was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times and the copilot called for the PIC to go around.
The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC to go around.
The aircraft overran the departure end of runway 09, to the right of the centerline at 110 knots. The aircraft crossed a road, and impacted an embankment before stopping in a rice paddy field 252 meters from the threshold of runway 27 (departure end of runway 09).

The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 11:06 the second officer contacted Gimhae Approach. At that moment the airplane was 32 nm from the airport at an altitude of FL170. The approach controller cleared the flight to descend to 6000 feet. Runway 36L was in use and the crew could expect a straight-in approach. at 11:09 the controller notified the crew that the runway was changed to 18R, with winds 210 degrees at 17 kts. This meant a circling approach which none of the crew members had flown yet at Pusan. The captain and first officer then discussed the approach to be flown. The captain cautioned: ""We won't enlarge the traffic pattern, the mountains are
all over that side."" At 11:13 the flight was further cleared down to 2600 feet. Two minutes later the approach controller radioed: ""Air China 129, turn left heading 030 cleared for ILS DME runway 36L, then circle to runway 18 right, report field in sight."" At 11:17 they captured the ILS and were cleared further down to the circling altitude of 700 feet. The landing gear was extended and flaps set at 20 degrees. Then the controller instructed the flight to contact Gimhae Tower and to circle west. The second officer responded but did not read back the frequency change. The captain then instructed the first officer to disconnect the autopilot and turn left. From his position in the right hand seat the first officer was able to observe the runway. As the aircraft passed abeam the
runway the autopilot was reengaged with heading select. At that moment the approach controller again contacted flight 129 instructing them to contact
the tower. The crew were busy looking outside to see when they passed abeam the end of the runway. Simultaneously the Gimhae Tower controller contacted
the flight using the emergency frequency. As they passed abeam the threshold at 11:20:02 they started timing to measure the commencement f turning to
base. Eleven seconds after the call on the emergency frequency, the second officer reported to the Tower controller that they were on the circle approach. At 11:20:17 the captain took over control from the first officer and said he was going to turn base. He slowly began a widening turn, causing the first officer to urge him: ""turn quickly, not too late."" Meanwhile the flight was cleared to land . At 11:20:32 the captain disconnected the autopilot and banked the plane to the right. Twenty-two seconds later the first officer cautioned: ""Pay attention to the altitude keeping,"" and the captain asked him to help him get a visual on the runway. Due to the limited visibility they were not able to see the runway. The first officer then advised the captain to initiate a go around, but the captain did
not respond. At 11:21:15 the first officer said, ""Pull up! Pull up!"" Pitch attitude was increased to 11.4 degrees but thrust was not increased. Two seconds later the aircraft impacted a mountain, about 4.6 km from the runway.";11:21;Boeing 767-2J6ER;Air China;Monday 15 April 2002

The flight crew also continued with other recommended best practice emergency procedures which included various manoeuvres to induce additional ""G"" forces on the aircraft to try and release the left main landing gear, but this was also unsuccessful. 
The flight crew elected to return to Lanseria because they thought that the facilities to handle emergencies of this nature were better. The flight crew continued to execute the emergency gear deployment procedures while en route to Lanseria, without success. When the aircraft was inbound approaching Lanseria, the flight crew establish contact with ATC and they were given instructions to hold over the beacon (HBV) near Hartebeespoortdam. After a while they were routed to hold over the beacon (LIV) near Lanseria, where the flight crew burned off fuel. All normal and emergency procedures used by the flight crew to extend the left main landing gear were unsuccessful. 
After being airborne for a period of 2.9 hours, the flight crew were given clearance by ATC to land on runway 06. The intention of the flight crew was to do a low level fly-past in front of the tower for confirmation that the left main landing gear was still not extended. The flight crew then recycled the gear up in preparation for the planned wheels up emergency landing. The flight crew made a teardrop manoeuvre to turn back in the opposite direction to approach runway 24R. During short finals overhead the threshold, prior to touchdown, the flight crew shut down both engines, feathered the propellers and switched off all the electrical power. The radios were off, thus no further communication between the flight crew and Lanseria ATC was possible. The aircraft came to a gradual stop on its lower fuselage on the centreline of the runway";ca 11:00;Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II;West Cape Ferries;Sunday 13 June 2010

The captain was Pilot Flying. 
The en route part of the first leg was uneventful. Runway in use at Terceira-Lajes Airport was runway 15. There was a partially cloudy sky, good visibility, a strong surface wind from southwest (190° at 22 kts gusting to 32 kts), with direction variations between 160° and 230° and the air temperature was 15°C. 
The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 15 seemed normal until 5 NM from touchdown. Winds were registered at a speed of up to 50 kts and there was severe turbulence along the entire approach. 
Below 1000 feet the crew noticed effects of down-drafts and up-drafts, with huge variations in intensity until short final. The captain stated that he opted to maintain an angle of descent (G/S) above the recommended, due to severe turbulence and to ensure a safety margin. The entire approach was flown with Auto Thrust connected, for effective and accurate speed control. 
The aircraft developed a high sink rate and lost speed instantly. This was counteracted by the captain with increasing power and attitude, in an attempt to stabilize the sink-rate.
Touchdown occurred with a high rate of descent and a short flare, resulting in an impact on the main landing gear of 3.52 G vertical acceleration, followed by a bounce.
A forward push of the control column by the pilot flying resulted in a pitch-down attitude of -1.9° with a second impact of 2.75 G vertical acceleration over the nose wheel causing substantial damage in that area of the aircraft fuselage.

An inspection revealed the existence of some folded braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay with some bent struts, cracks found in fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads applied in the contact with the runway.";06:41;Boeing 737-86N (WL);Travel Service Airlines;Saturday 22 February 2014

The captain tried to do a recovery manoeuvre by applying differential power, reverse, and braking, however these manoeuvres were unsuccessful. The left wing came into contact with the airport building, sheering off the left winglet and wing tip down to the wing rib located below the wing fence. The aircraft continued past the building before coming to rest with the winglet and debris resting behind it. The 4 passengers and 2 crew members disembarked without any injury.

Company maintenance inspected the aircraft and concluded that there was no structural damage. During this inspection, the engine rigging was checked to ensure that power management was not a factor in this event. No major discrepancies were found and ground runs were normal.

The crash site was approximately 5 nautical miles northeast of the airport in Clarence Center, New York, and mostly confined to one residential house (6038 Long St, Clarence) . The four flight crew and 45 passengers were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post crash fire. There was one ground fatality. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. 
Flight CJC3407 departed Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR) at 21:20 on a domestic flight to Buffalo Airport, NY (BUF). At 22:15:14 the Buffalo Approach controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 23: ""Colgan thirty four zero seven three miles from klump turn left heading two six zero maintain two thousand three hundred till established localizer clear i l s approach runway two three."" The flight acknowledged that clearance.
At 22:16:02, the engine power levers were reduced to flight idle. At that time Buffalo Approach instructed the crew to contact Buffalo Tower. The crew extended the landing gear and the auto flight system captured the ILS 23 localizer. The captain then moved the engine conditions levers forward to the maximum RPM position as the copilot acknowledged the instructions to Buffalo Tower. 
At 22:16:28 the crew moved the flaps to 10°, and two seconds later the stall warning stick shaker activated. The autopilot disconnected at about the same time that the stick shaker activated. The crew added power to approximately 75% torque. The airplane began a sharp pitch up motion, accompanied by a left roll, followed by a right roll, during which the stick pusher activated. During this time, the indicated airspeed continued to decrease to less than 100 kts. Eight seconds after the flaps had been selected to 10°, and at an airspeed of less than 110 kts, the crew retracted the flaps. Sixteen seconds later the flaps were fully retracted.

A few seconds after taking off from runway 33, the landing gear lever was selected to the Up position. About 20 seconds later, the crew discovered that the landing gear had not retracted. The landing gear remained in the Down & Locked position because the landing gear safety pins were set. The crew suspected that the safety pins were still set and decided to land back at Salzburg Airport, which was carried out on runway 15. After a flight time of about 5 minutes, the aircraft left the runway at about 10:17 on taxiway E. They were instructed by the control tower to taxi back to the parking area (apron). 
The aircraft was stopped shortly after taxiing on taxiway E, as the crew noticed an increased rolling resistance of the aircraft, whereby the crew suspected a burst tyre. The crew decided to check directly at the taxiway whether the safety pins were still on the landing gear, to remove them if necessary and to check whether a tire was defective. The control tower of Salzburg Airport was not informed about this by the pilots. The co-pilot opened the cabin door and left the aircraft to perform these checks. Meanwhile, the pilot left the cockpit to inform the passengers in the cabin of the situation.
At 10:20 and 10:22, the Salzburg Tower controller tried without success to make contact with the aircraft's crew. An aircraft passing taxiway L informed the controller about a person on the taxiway who had left the aircraft in question.
The co-pilot, who had gone to the landing gear, recognized that the safety pins were installed and tried to remove them. When this attempt failed because hydraulic pressure was applied to the landing gear cylinder and the safety pin was jammed, he operated the landing gear door control valves of the nose and main landing gear several times and installed the landing gear doors control valve pins. This closed the landing gear doors, the main cylinders of the hydraulics of the main and nose landing gear were depressurized and the safety pins could be removed. After the co-pilot removed the nose landing gear door pin, the nose landing gear doors opened and the nose landing gear folded at about 10:30. The aircraft nose lowered and hit the taxiway. 5 to 10 seconds later the engines were switched off.

The aircraft was substantially damaged, and there were no injuries to the 148 occupants. Weather at the time of the event was reported as winds from 340 degrees at 6 knots, clear skies and 10 miles visibility.

According to the flight crew, the preflight, departure and enroute segments of the flight were normal. The approach was flown with a Vref speed of 129 knots and 25 degrees of flap. Upon landing, the first officer called ""speedbrakes not activated"" and manually deployed the speedbrakes. The captain reported he felt the airplane ""float"" and attempted to maintain landing attitude. FDR data indicated that the airplane made an initial touchdown, followed by a brief gear squat switch deactivation, consistent with a slight bounce or light touchdown; the speedbrakes were then manually deployed. Airspeed decayed to approximately 115 knots and pitch attitude increased to about 11 degrees. The Delta 757/767 Flight Crew Training Manual specifies that contact with the runway is possible with pitch attitude greater than 10.5 degrees, with flaps 25 and airspeed of 10 knots below Vref.

Both crew members were not injured.
Bin Air flight BID-3B originated in Manston International Airport, UK (MSE). 
The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 10 at Dublin. The approach was a CAT 1 approach. Weather conditions at Dublin were poor with visibility approximately 1,100 metres and a cloudbase of approximately 300 ft. Dublin was operating in low visibility abeyance. Runway Visual Ranges (RVRs) at 08:28 hrs were 1,600 m at touchdown, 1,800 m at midpoint and 1.600 m at stopend. The aircraft broke out of cloud at about 650 ft, approximately 200 ft above the minimum for the CAT 1 approach, and the pilots could see three white Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights.
As per normal procedure, after landing the First Officer who was Pilot Flying (PF) gave the controls to the captain who was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) so the he (PF) could complete the ""Leaving the Runway"" checklist. This checklist is completed from memory and included booster pump and flap-to-zero selections. The PNF recalled that during the landing roll, while the aircraft was braking and the indicated airspeed was below 90 kts, the nose gear suddenly collapsed. Both propellers contacted the runway surface and the aircraft quickly came to a halt resting on its nose. The Flight Crew then shutdown both engines, requested fire service assistance, selected batteries & generators to OFF and evacuated the aircraft through the cabin door.
The Airport Fire Fighting personnel were on the scene within two minutes. There was no fire.
The PF reported that it was a foggy day and that the approach was flown on limits with a lot of tension because of the uncertainty as to whether the aircraft would be able to land at Dublin. He described how concerns that fog might roll in raised his stress levels during the approach. During the landing roll, the landing gear selector was inadvertently moved to the UP position. This mistake was immediately recognised and the selector was returned to the DOWN position, but the nose-wheel retraction, which had been initiated, continued. The PF was unable to say definitively why the landing gear selector may have been mis-selected to UP, but he said that the intention may have been to move the Flap Selector instead.";08:33;Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III;Bin Air;Thursday 7 March 2013

When reaching his initial destination of Sidney, the pilot performed a low pass over the runway to enable maintenance personnel on the ground do a visual assessment. A mechanic stated that the nose gear was extended. The pilot diverted to Billings and the air traffic control personnel confirmed observing the nose gear extended at a 45-degree angle.
The pilot further stated that he aligned with runway 28R and just prior to touch down, he feathered the propellers and decreased the airspeed. During touchdown, the right gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest on the centerline.

There were no injuries among the 22 passengers and three crew members.
Danish Air Transport flight DTR54 was on a scheduled flight from Bergen to Florø (FRO). During takeoff the pilots experienced considerable control problems related to the elevator function. They declared an emergency situation and returned for landing. The landing was accomplished without further incident 7 minutes after takeoff.
After landing it was found that the control problems were caused by the right elevator hanging below the horizontal stabiliser, attached only by the inboard of the three hinges that normally connect the elevator to the stabiliser. A bolt was missing from both the centre and outer hinges. Both of the bolts and one of the nuts that normally should connect the hinge assemblies together were found. One of the bolts was found on the runway, the other inside the elevator.
Investigation indicates that the bolt belonging to the outer hinge assembly fell out during the takeoff in question, while the bolt in the centre hinge assembly had fallen out at an earlier point in time, without being discovered. The report concludes that the self-locking nuts cannot have been tightened with the required torque when the elevator was fitted. This error was most probably introduced after the aircraft was repainted in 1999.";11:28;ATR 42-320;Danish Air Transport;Monday 31 January 2005

All four passengers and three crew members were killed in the accident.
During the engine start process, the flight crew neglected to disengage the airplane's gust lock system, which locks the elevator, ailerons, and rudder while the airplane is parked to protect them against wind gust loads. Further, before initiating takeoff, the pilots neglected to perform a flight control check that would have alerted them of the locked flight controls. A review of data from the airplane’s quick access recorder revealed that the pilots had neglected to perform complete flight control checks before 98% of their previous 175 takeoffs in the airplane, indicating that this oversight was habitual and not an anomaly.
A mechanical interlock between the gust lock handle and the throttle levers restricts the movement of the throttle levers when the gust lock handle is in the ON position. According to Gulfstream, the interlock mechanism was intended to limit throttle lever movement to a throttle lever angle (TLA) of no greater than 6° during operation with the gust lock on. However, postaccident testing on nine in-service G-IV airplanes found that, with the gust lock handle in the ON position, the forward throttle lever movement that could be achieved on the G-IV was 3 to 4 times greater than the intended TLA of 6°.
During takeoff from runway 11 at Bedford-Hanscom Field, which is 2137 m (7011 feet) long, the pilot-in-command (PIC) manually advanced the throttle levers, but the engine pressure ratio (EPR) did not reach the expected level due to the throttles contacting the gust lock/throttle lever interlock. The PIC did not immediately reject the takeoff; instead, he engaged the autothrottle, and the throttle levers moved slightly forward, which allowed the engines to attain an EPR value that approached (but never reached) the target setting. 
As the takeoff roll continued, the second-in-command made the standard takeoff speed callouts as the airplane successively reached 80 knots, the takeoff safety speed, and the rotation speed. When the PIC attempted to rotate the airplane, he discovered that he could not move the control yoke and began calling out ""(steer) lock is on."" At this point, the PIC clearly understood that the controls were locked but still did not immediately initiate a rejected takeoff. If the flight crew had initiated a rejected takeoff at the time of the PIC’s first ""lock is on"" comment or at any time up until about 11 seconds after this comment, the airplane could have been stopped on the paved surface. However, the flight crew delayed applying brakes for about 10 seconds and further delayed reducing power by 4 seconds; therefore, the rejected takeoff was not initiated until the accident was unavoidable.
The airplane thus failed to stop on the runway and continued onto the runway safety area and then the grass. The airplane continued on the grass, where it struck approach lighting and a localizer antenna assembly, before coming to rest in a gully, on about runway heading, about 1,850 feet from the end of the runway. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the airplane aft of the cockpit; however; all major portions of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The nose gear and left main landing gear separated during the accident sequence and were located on the grass area between the safety area and the gully.";21:40;Gulfstream G-IV;null;Saturday 31 May 2014

He called 'stop', retarded the power levers to idle, applied reverse thrust, extended the speed brake and applied brakes. The nose of the aircraft touched down hard, causing the front left door (L1) to open and two trolleys at front galley to move forward, blocking the cockpit door. The flight crew turned the aircraft slightly to the right to avoid approach lights ahead. It hit some trees and stopped at approx. 275 meters from the end of runway.;10:15;Boeing 737-291;Lion Air;Monday 14 January 2002

The aircraft was restored to original condition with Pan American Airlines livery, carrying the name ""Clipper Flying Cloud"". On March 28, 2002 the aircraft took off from Boeing Field for a local flight around 12:30. The crew were to practice takeoffs and landings and shake out any mechanical problems. Both pilots were planning to do three takeoffs and landings each, with a refueling stop in between. The first pair were uneventful, with the plane flying from Boeing Field to Everett-Paine Field. On takeoff there, at 12:51, the No. 3 engine surged briefly. It returned to normal, but the pilots decided to abort the rest of the practice and return to Boeing Field. On approach it appeared that the left-main landing gear had not locked down. The approach was aborted and the plane circled Vashon and Bainbridge islands as the flight mechanic manually cranked the wheel into the locked position. The pilot then resumed its approach. The airplane was about 6 miles from the runway when fuel pressure for the number three engine dropped below minimum. The boost pumps were turned on; however, fuel pressure did not recover, and the engine lost power. The low fuel pressure light then illuminated for the number four engine. The captain commanded the flight engineer to switch fuel feed to another tank. The flight engineer's response was, ""There is no other tank. We're out of fuel."" The captain pushed the throttles forward and called for the number three engine to be feathered. When the throttles were pushed forward, multiple engine surges occurred. Then the surging stopped, and it appeared that the remaining engines had also lost power. The airplane was rapidly losing altitude and the captain decided to ditch in Elliott Bay. After landing, the airplane remained afloat while the crew evacuated. They were quickly picked up by rescue boats. The airplane was subsequently towed to shallower water by a Seattle Police Department boat before it partially sank in the water just offshore.

Approximately one hour into the flight, while the aircraft was in cruise at flight level 330 (FL330), the crew experienced the sudden onset of heavy airframe vibration and received an ENG 3 REVERSER annunciation from the engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS). The crew initially reduced the no.3 engine power and carried out the 'Engine Reverser Unlocked' actions from the aircraft quick-reference handbook (QRH). The crew stated that the engine appeared to be functioning normally at that time. After further EICAS status and advisory messages however, the crew elected to carry out other QRH checklists, concluding with the shutdown of the no. 3 engine. The captain made a PAN call to air traffic control and subsequently an advisory announcement to the passengers. To reduce airframe vibration after the engine was shut down, the first officer, who was the handling pilot, descended the aircraft to FL180 and reduced airspeed. A third crew member who was resting at the time of the event went back into the cabin to examine the engines and found extensive damage to the no. 3 engine nacelle and strut fairings. After that information was reported to the flight crew, a further QRH checklist Fire Engine, Severe Damage or Separation was actioned, although at no time was there any reported indication or sign of fire. A decision to return to Sydney was made and fuel was jettisoned to establish a landing weight within limits. In consideration of the damage to the engine and to minimise the risk should the engine or components separate, an over-water approach to runway 34L was requested.

The next flight was an on-demand charter flight for Caesar's Palace Casino to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport (AVP). An IFR flight plan was filed and the flight departed at 10:30.
The pilots first contacted AVP approach controllers at 10:57 and were vectored for an ILS approach to runway 04. The flight was cleared for approach at 11:02:07, and the approach controller advised the pilots that they were 5 nautical miles (nm) from Crystal Lake, which is the initial approach fix (IAF) for the ILS approach to runway 04. The pilots were told to maintain 4,000 feet until established on the localizer. At 11:04:16, the approach controller advised that a previous landing aircraft picked up the airport at minimums [decision altitude]. The pilots were instructed to contact the AVP local (tower) controller at 11:05:09, which they did 3 seconds later. The airplane then descended to about 2,200 feet, flew level at 2,200 feet for about 20 seconds, and began to climb again about 2.2 nm from the runway threshold when a missed approach was executed. At 11:07:26 the captain reported executing the missed approach but provided no explanation to air traffic controllers. The tower controller informed the North Radar approach controllers of the missed approach and then instructed the accident flight crew to fly runway heading, climb to 4,000 feet, and contact approach control. The pilots re-established contact with the approach controllers at 11:08:04 as they climbed through 3,500 feet to 4,000 feet and requested another ILS approach to runway 04. The flight was vectored for another ILS approach, and at 11:10:07 the approach controller advised the pilots of traffic 2 nm miles away at 5,000 feet. The captain responded that they were in the clouds. At 11:14:38, the controller directed the pilots to reduce speed to follow a Cessna 172 on approach to the airport, and the captain responded, ""ok we're slowing."" The flight was cleared for a second approach at 11:20:45 and advised to maintain 4,000 feet until the airplane was established on the localizer. At 11:23:49 the captain transmitted, ""for uh one six echo juliet we'd like to declare an emergency."" At 11:23:53, the approach controller asked the nature of the problem, and the captain responded, ""engine failure."" The approach controller acknowledged the information, informed the pilots that the airplane appeared to be south of the localizer (off course to the right), and asked if they wanted a vector back to the localizer course. The flight crew accepted, and at 11:24:10 the controller directed a left turn to heading 010, which the captain acknowledged. At 11:24:33, the controller asked for verification that the airplane was turning left. The captain responded, ""we're trying six echo juliet."" At 11:24:38, the controller asked if a right turn would be better. The captain asked the controller to ""stand by."" At 11:25:07, the controller advised the pilots that the minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) in the area was 3,300 feet. At 11:25:12, the captain transmitted, ""standby for six echo juliet tell them we lost both engines for six echo juliet."" At that time, ATC radar data indicated that the airplane was descending through 3,000 feet. The controller immediately issued the weather conditions in the vicinity of the airport and informed the flight crew about the location of nearby highways. At 11:26:17, the captain asked, ""how's the altitude look for where we're at."" The controller responded that he was not showing an altitude readout from the airplane and issued the visibility (2.5 miles) and altimeter setting. At 11:26:43, the captain transmitted, ""just give us a vector back to the airport please."" The controller cleared the accident flight to fly heading 340, advised the flight crew that radar contact was lost, and asked the pilots to verify their altitude. The captain responded that they were ""level at 2,000."" At 11:26:54, the controller again advised the flight crew of the 3,300-foot MVA and suggested a 330° heading to bring the airplane back to the localizer. At 11:27:14 the controller asked, ""do you have any engines,"" and the captain responded that they appeared to have gotten back ""the left engine now."" At 11:27:23, the controller informed the pilots that he saw them on radar at 2,000 feet and that there was a ridgeline between them and the airport. The captain responded, ""that's us"" and ""we're at 2,000 feet over the trees."" The controller instructed the pilots to fly a 360° heading and advised them of high antennas about 2 nm west of their position. At 11:27:46, the captain transmitted, ""we're losing both engines."" Two seconds later the controller advised that the Pennsylvania Turnpike was right below the airplane and instructed the flight crew to ""let me know if you can get your engines back.""

The shimmying stopped when braking was reduced but restarted when braking was increased, causing the torsion link to fracture. Further higher amplitude shimmying of the left MLG ensued, resulting in severe MLG tyre, wheel and brake damage and substantial oscillatory loads on the aircraft structure. Steering difficulties were experienced during both shimmying episodes.
It was likely that the shimmying resulted from excessive wear of the torsion link apex joint that reduced the effectiveness of the shimmy damper. Maintenance records indicated that the MLG had been maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, but it was considered that relevant Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) procedures could be difficult to

The crew cycled the gear back down and got a ""three green"" normal indication. They cycled the gear back up and again got the ""gear unsafe"" light. They cycled the gear three more times with the same results. The crew decided to return to Asheville, and upon extending the gear for a visual landing at Asheville, the right main landing gear green light did not illuminate. The crew stated that they performed all of the checklist procedures and asked the control tower personnel to visually look to see if the gear was down and that tower personnel reported that it was. The crew asked the tower personnel if the landing light was on, and tower personnel replied that is was not. According to the flight crew, they went through the emergency procedures again, but they had no luck in getting the landing gear to lock down. They said that there was no landing light and that they got the gear horn with the gear down and full flaps with the throttles at idle. The crew stated they were sure that the gear was out of the uplocks but not down and locked. The crew stated that, after talking with maintenance personnel on the ground at Asheville, they decided to divert to Greensboro/High Point-Piedmont Triad International Airport, NC (GSO), where there were better facilities to handle the situation.

Examination of the landing gear components did not reveal any internal failures or malfunctions. Testing revealed it was possible for the side brace actuator to unlock mechanically by repeated cyclic compressive loading. The compressive load was cycled between near zero, up to values ranging from 1/2 the maximum limit value to near the maximum limit values.

After the demonstration flight an IFR flight plan was filed for a flight to Ontario, CA (ONT) with a planned en route altitude of 10,000 feet. The airplane departed at approximately 16:35. About 16:55 the flight had reached an altitude of about 8500 feet. 
At that time the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control controller advised the pilots that radar contact was established that they were heading into rising terrain. The controller asked, ""Do you have the terrain in sight?"" At 16:55:03, one of the pilots responded ""8 Whiskey Echo, we're maneuvering away from the terrain right now."" Nine seconds later radio contact was lost. The Cessna struck a ridge and crashed. The elevation at the accident site was 6,073 feet.";16:55;Cessna 208B Grand Caravan;Cessna Aircraft;Tuesday 28 March 2006

The pilot, the sole occupant in the airplane, was not injured. The pilot was flying on an activated instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, which had an intended destination of Kalispell, Montana.
The pilot said that he had departed from Billings, Montana, and had climbed to 12,000 feet. About 40 nautical miles northwest of Billings, he heard a ""clunk"" and the red unsafe light in the gear handle came on. He verified that all systems were functioning normally, and he cycled the landing gear up and down to see if that would solve the problem. The unsafe light remained illuminated. The pilot returned to Billings and circled for several hours to burn his fuel load down. He said that at one point he flew low over the runway so the company mechanic, with the aid of a light from an airport vehicle, could visually check the nose gear position. It was hanging out of the wheel well at approximately a 45-degree angle. Upon landing at Billings, the airplane settled to its nose during landing rollout. 
Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the nose gear actuator mount bracket area was bent and wrinkled. The nose gear actuator shaft had fractured just above the clevis bolt, which attaches to the drag brace. The failed actuator had been installed on July 26, 2006. The Beech B99 maintenance manual states that the hydraulic actuator needs to be overhauled or replaced every 10,000 hours; maintenance records indicate that this one had 231.4 hours on it at the time of the accident. Metallurgists from both the National Transportation Safety Board and Hawker Beechcraft Corporation examined the failed actuator. Both concluded that all of the fractures were overstress, and no preexisting fatigue signatures were evident.";04:00;Beechcraft B99;Alpine Aviation;Saturday 19 May 2007

The airplane carried 29 passengers and four crew members. One passenger survived the accident.
The airplane operated on behalf of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on flight UNO834, a round trip from Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH) to Kisangani (FKI). 
The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 12:18. The pilot in command was the pilot flying on this leg.
At 13:31, the crew reported to Kinshasa Approach that they were over position GURUT (137 NM from Kinshasa), gave their Expected Time of Arrival Kinshasa as 13:55 and received the latest Kinshasa weather information. At the time, Kinshasa weather being reported was wind 340 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 10 km, scattered clouds at 2500 feet, Charlie Bravos (CBs) at 3000 feet, CBs in the North East and South East, Temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1009, trend NOSIG.
At 13:39, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield.
At 13:49, when the aircraft was about 32 NMs from Kinshasa VOR/DME, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting ""wind 210 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 8 KM, thunderstorm over the station, scattered cloud at 2500 feet, few Charlie Bravo 3000 feet, Charlie Bravo located north-east, south west and west, broken 12000 feet, temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1008, trend NOSIG"". The co-pilot replied to ATC that weather was copied and read back the QNH.
At 13:50, UNO 854 was cleared for a straight-in Localizer approach for runway 24. The crew discussed options of avoiding the severe weather being displayed on their on-board weather radar by skirting around the radar returns. The aircraft approached the airfield at high speed. The indicated air speed came below 250 knots at 13:53 when the aircraft was descending through an altitude of 4630 feet and was 13 NM from threshold runway 24.
While intercepting the Localizer for runway 24, the aircraft remained to the south (left) of the Localizer path. During the execution of the Localizer Approach, the crew made a more than 15 degree heading change to fly even further away from the Localizer path when the aircraft was between 10-7 NM from runway 24.
As the aircraft came close to the airfield, the co-pilot sighted the runway on his right one o'clock position, when the aircraft was about 9.7 nautical miles from displaced threshold of runway 24. The PIC too, sighted the runway when the aircraft was about 6.4 NM away from threshold. At that stage, the aircraft speed was 210 knots, altitude was 3250 feet (or about 2252 feet above ground level) and the aircraft was in clean configuration. The crew decided to continue their Approach. The captain disengaged the autopilot, turned towards the runway and gave instructions to co-pilot to configure the aircraft for landing. The crew managed to regain Localizer path and align the aircraft to the runway by the time they were 2 NM from the threshold.
At around this time, Kinshasa airfield was affected by a squall line. As the aircraft came on short finals, it encountered rain. By this stage, the aircraft was below the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for Localizer Approach for runway 24. MDA for Localizer Approach for Runway 24 is 1470 feet or 472 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The crew switched on wind shield wipers. As they descended further to about 224 feet AGL and runway was not in sight, the crew decided to carry out a go around. During the process of go around, a positive rate of climb was established with appropriate airspeed.
While climbing through an altitude of 1395 feet (or 397 feet AGL); the aircraft encountered a severe weather phenomenon (probably a microburst). The wind shear warning came on. The aircraft pitched significantly nose down (from about 4-5 degrees nose up attitude to 7 degrees nose down attitude) in a very short period of time. The aircraft rapidly lost height. Before the crew could react to the pitch down and recover from the steep descent, the aircraft impacted the terrain. The airplane broke up and the main wreckage came to rest upside down.";13:56;Canadair CL-600-2B19 Regional Jet CRJ-100ER;null;Monday 4 April 2011

The outbound flight IX-811 was uneventful and landed at Dubai at 23:44 hours Local Time. The airplane was serviced and refuelled. The same flight crew operated the return leg, flight IX-812. 
The airplane taxied out for departure at 01:06 LT (02:36 IST). The takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful. There was no conversation between the two pilots for about 1 hour and 40 minutes because the captain was asleep. The First Officer was making all the radio calls.
The aircraft reported position at IGAMA at 05:33 hours IST and the First Officer was told to expect an ILS DME Arc approach to Mangalore. At about 130 miles from Mangalore, the First Officer requested descent clearance. This was, however, denied by the ATC Controller, who was using standard procedural control, to ensure safe separation with other air traffic. At 05:46 IST, the flight reported its position when it was at 80 DME as instructed by Mangalore Area Control. The aircraft was cleared to 7000 ft and commenced descent at 77 DME from Mangalore at 05:47 IST. The visibility reported was 6 km. Mangalore airport has a table top runway. As the AIP India states ""Aerodrome located on hilltop. Valleys 200ft to 250ft immediately beyond paved surface of Runway."" Owing to the surrounding terrain, Air India Express had made a special qualification requirement that only the PIC shall carry out the take off and landing. The captain on the accident flight had made a total of 16 landings in the past at this airport and the First Officer had operated as a Co-pilot on 66 flights at this airport.
While the aircraft had commenced descent, there was no recorded conversation regarding the mandatory preparation for descent and landing briefing as stipulated in the SOP. After the aircraft was at about 50 miles and descending out of FL295, the conversation between the two pilots indicated that an incomplete approach briefing had been carried out.
At about 25 nm from DME and descending through FL184, the Mangalore Area Controller cleared the aircraft to continue descent to 2900 ft. At this stage, the First Officer requested, if they could proceed directly to Radial 338 and join the 10 DME Arc. Throughout the descent profile and DME Arc Approach for ILS 24, the aircraft was much higher than normally expected altitudes.
The aircraft was handed over by the Mangalore Area Controller to ATC Tower at 05:52 IST. The Tower controller, thereafter, asked the aircraft to report having established on 10 DME Arc for ILS Runway 24.
Considering that this flight was operating in WOCL (Window Of Circadian Low), by this time the First Officer had also shown signs of tiredness. This was indicated by the sounds of yawning heard on the CVR.
On having reported 10 DME Arc, the ATC Tower had asked aircraft to report when established on ILS. It appears that the captain had realised that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal and had selected Landing Gear 'DOWN' at an altitude of approximately 8,500 ft with speed brakes still deployed in Flight Detent position, so as to increase the rate of descent. As indicated by the DFDR, the aircraft continued to be high and did not follow the standard procedure of intercepting the ILS Glide Path at the correct intercept altitude. This incorrect procedure led to the aircraft being at almost twice the altitude as compared to a Standard ILS Approach.
During approach, the CVR indicated that the captain had selected Flaps 40 degrees and completed the Landing Check List. At 06:03 hours IST at about 2.5 DME, the Radio Altimeter had alerted an altitude of 2500 ft. This was immediately followed by the First Officer saying ""It is too high"" and ""Runway straight down"". In reply, the captain had exclaimed ""Oh my god"". At this moment, the captain had disconnected the Auto Pilot and simultaneously increased the rate of descent considerably to establish on the desired approach path. At this stage, the First Officer had queried ""Go around?""
To this query from the First Officer, the captain had called out ""Wrong loc .. ... localiser .. ... glide path"". 
The First Officer had given a second call to the captain for ""Go around"" followed by ""Unstabilised"". However, the First Officer did not appear to take any action, to initiate a Go Around. Having acquired the runway visually and to execute a landing, it appears that the captain had increased the rate of descent to almost 4000 ft per minute. Due to this, there were numerous warnings from EGPWS for 'SINK RATE' and 'PULL UP'. On their own, the pilots did not report having established on ILS Approach.
Instead, the ATC Tower had queried the same. To this call, the captain had forcefully prompted the First Officer to give a call of ""Affirmative"". The Tower controller gave landing clearance thereafter and also indicated ""Winds calm"".
The aircraft was high on approach and touched down on the runway, much farther than normal. The aircraft had crossed the threshold at about 200 ft altitude with indicated speed in excess of 160 kt, as compared to 50 ft with target speed of 144 kt for the landing weight.
Despite the EGPWS warnings and calls from the First Officer to go around, the captain had persisted with the approach in unstabilised conditions. Short of touchdown, there was yet another (Third) call from the First Officer, ""Go around captain...We don't have runway left"". However, the captain had continued with the landing and the final touchdown was about 5200 ft from the threshold of runway 24, leaving approximately 2800 ft of remaining paved surface.
The captain had selected Thrust Reversers soon after touchdown. Within 6 seconds of applying brakes, the captain had initiated a 'Go Around', in contravention of Boeing SOP. The aircraft overshot the runway including the strip of 60 metres. After overshooting the runway and strip, the aircraft continued into the Runway End Safety Area (RESA) of 90 metres. Soon after which the right wing impacted the localiser antenna structure located further at 85 metres from the end of RESA. Thereafter, the aircraft hit the boundary fence and fell into a gorge.";06:05;Boeing 737-8HG (WL);Air India Express;Saturday 22 May 2010

None of the eleven occupants were injured.
The airplane operated on scheduled flight M3990 from OLA (Ørland) to OSL. During roll-out following a normal landing, when the aircraft's speed had decreased to less than 60 kt, the aircraft started an uncommanded turn to the right. The nose wheel steering system was activated. The course could not be corrected, and the aircraft veered off the side of the runway where it became stuck in hard-packed snow one meter deep.
The investigation has shown that the loss of control was most likely caused by a fault in the nose wheel steering. The same problem had occurred six days earlier, but the commander then managed to disconnect the nose wheel steering in time and regained control. The fault could not be reproduced, and the aircraft was released to service after inspection and testing without remarks.
The nose wheel steering system on this aircraft type is relatively complex, and over time several improvements have been made to improve its reliability. The Flight Manual has a caution related to activation of nose wheel steering at speeds higher than normal taxi speed.

All 121 passengers and six crew members were killed. Bhoja Airlines flight 213 departed Karachi (KHI) at 17:05 on a domestic flight to Islamabad (ISB). This was the inaugural evening flight for the airline on this route.
The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of FL310 and continued towards Islamabad. Weather at the destination was poor due to a passing thunderstorm. At 18:19 the captain at a distance observed the squall line. Moments later the flight was cleared to descend to FL200. During the descent the captain and first officer discussed the weather. They were worried about the severity of the thunderstorm ahead.
At 18:26 the first officer contacted Islamabad Approach and received clearance for the One Foxtrot arrival for an ILS approach to runway 30. After receiving further descent clearance the first officer discussed opportunities to approach the airfield through a gap in the squall line. The Approach controller gave radar vectors and descent instructions to fly through the gap in the storm.
At 18:35, Islamabad Approach gave a weather update and said ""Bhoja 213 surface wind at Islamabad ah is varying between 180° to 270°, 10 kts and ah sometimes gusting to 20 kts and runway condition is wet, light drizzle is ah uhm going on, braking action not known"".
Two minutes later the airplane entered the squall line. Although the Bhoja Air Operational Manual prohibited flight in these conditions, the captain decided to continue. The airplane was configured for the approach with flaps and slats selected and the undercarriage was down. The first officer then reported the speed to be 220 knots, which was 30 knots higher than the recommended speed. The captain reacted surprised as he did not expect this because the he was flying with the auto-throttle engaged. Likely the increase in speed was a result of windshear. The aircraft then entered the active weather cell with precipitation continuing in varying intensity. At 18:39 the airplane captured the ILS and descended on the glide slope. At this point the aircraft should have been in landing configuration with flaps at 30°. However, only flaps 5 were selected. 
The aircraft then encountered an increasing downdraft. The pitch attitude increased and computed airspeed decreased as the autopilot attempted to maintain the glide slope. The GPWS consequently sounded with the aural alarm: ""Wind shear - Wind shear - Wind shear"". Although the first officer anxiously called for a go around, no action was taken.
The downdraft dissipated and the pitch attitude decreased but the aircraft deviated left of the extended runway centerline, and was brought back by the captain. At that moment the autopilot disconnected due to the aircraft deviation beyond the autopilot maximum authority limits. The auto throttle remained engaged in IAS speed mode. Following autopilot disconnect, there was no control wheel activity recorded for approximately 6 seconds and no control column activity for approximately 8 seconds. The crew were likely confused. During this period of control inactivity, the aircraft deviated below the glide slope. 
Then the Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) alarm sounded: ""Whoop, Whoop, Whoop"". No action was taken by either crew member. A few seconds later the aircraft entered another downdraft and the rate of descent increased rapidly. The TAWS alarm sounded again, directing the crew to ""pull up"". The captain responded with a nose-up column input. However, pressure altitude and thrust continued to decrease. The downdraft dissipated rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in angle of attack of the aircraft, which activated the stick shaker for almost 2 seconds. It appeared that captain lowered the nose down to get out of stick shaker regime however, proper and complete Boeing recommended stall and recovery procedures were not carried out. This resulted in a 12° nose down pitch. Then another windshear alarm sounded, followed by another stick shaker activation. The first officer shouted to ""get out"" and ""go around"" but the attempts by the captain failed as he did not apply the proper procedures to execute a go around.
Shortly after initial ground contact, the aircraft struck a steeply sloped terrace about 5 meters high which resulted in significant structural breakup of the aircraft structure.";18:40;Boeing 737-236A;Bhoja Airlines;Friday 20 April 2012

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The two flight crew members and four passengers were uninjured. 
The captain, who was also the company chief pilot and check airman, was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the non flying pilot. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Area weather reporting stations reported the presence of freezing rain and snow for a time period beginning several hours before the accident. The captain did not obtain the destination airport weather observation until the flight was approximately 30 nautical miles from the airport. The flight received radar vectors for a instrument landing system approach to runway 30 (5,401 feet by 100 feet, grooved asphalt). The company's training manual states the MU-300's intermediate and final approach speeds as 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and Vref, respectively. Vref was reported by the flight crew as 106 KIAS. During the approach, the tower controller gave the option for the flight to circle to land or continue straight in to runway 30. He advised that the winds were from 050-070 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots, and runway braking action was reported as fair to poor by a snow plow. 
Radar data indicates that the airplane had a ground speed in excess of 200 knots between the final approach fix and runway threshold and a full-scale localizer deviation 5.5 nm from the localizer antenna. 
The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normal, according to the captain, until approximately the 3,000 foot marker. At that point the aircraft's deceleration slowed down and the aircraft began to skid. Approaching the end of the runway the captain noticed a drop off at beyond the end of the runway. The visibility was not good enough to determine what was beyond the drop-off. The captain decided to turn the aircraft to minimize the forward speed after exiting runway and to avoid going down the hill. The aircraft came to rest 30 feet beyond the departure end to the right of centerline.

The company did not have stabilized approach criteria establishing when a missed approach or go-around is to be executed. The captain stated that he was unaware that there was 0.7 percent downslope on runway 30. The company provided a page from their airport directory which did not indicate a slope present for runway 30.";09:01;Mitusbishi Mu-300 Diamond;Corporate Flight Management;Monday 25 March 2002

There were seven people on board; two pilots, two engineers, and three flight officers.
The pilots reported that the approach and landing were normal. However, both Beta lights did not illuminate during the landing roll, so they could not use reverse thrust. The crew used maximum brakes to slow the aircraft, and rolled through to the end of runway 15. During the 180-degree right turn at the end of the runway, they felt the left brakes grabbing, and had to use increased thrust on the left engine to assist the turn. After completing the turn, the pilots backtracked the aircraft towards taxiway E, about 450 meters from the departure end of runway 15.
The air traffic controller informed the Transall crew that heavy smoke was coming from the left main wheels, and that they should proceed to taxiway E and stop on the taxiway. Before the aircraft entered taxiway E, the controller activated the crash alarm.
The pilots stopped the aircraft on taxiway E, and the occupants disembarked and attempted to extinguish the wheel-bay fire with a hand held extinguisher. The airport rescue fire fighting service (RFFS) arrived at the aircraft 10 minutes after the aircraft came to a stop on taxiway E. It took a further 5 minutes to commence applying foam. The attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and the fire destroyed the aircraft and its cargo of fuel in drums.";ca 06:59;Transall C-160NG;Manunggal Air;Thursday 6 March 2008

The airplane was near the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, about 35 miles west-northwest of Grand Rapids, Michigan, when the accident occurred. 
The flight crew received a left thrust reverser unlock indication while holding for takeoff. The captain cycled the reverser, and had decided to return to the gate when the messages cleared. With the issue apparently resolved, he elected to takeoff. The captain reported experiencing a small vibration on climb out and, a short time later, he heard a ""loud bang"" and the ""aircraft pitched and yawed/rolled to [the] left."" The autopilot disengaged and the left thrust lever moved to idle during the event. The first officer ran the checklist to stow the reverser. The captain decided to continue to the intended destination because the thrust reverser messages had cleared and the vibrations had stopped. The flight subsequently landed uneventfully. The flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the left engine vibration levels were elevated during the accident flight. Approximately 3 minutes into the flight, the left engine thrust reverser unlocked parameter changed to ""On"" for about 1 second. About 11 minutes and 20 seconds after takeoff, the left engine vibration level increased momentarily, and both the left and right engine speeds and fuel flows began to decrease. As the decrease in fuel flows was occurring, the airplane rolled right, left, and right again over about a 4-second period. The decrease in engine parameters lasted over 3 minutes before returning to normal. The left engine thrust reverser unlock parameter indicated ""On"" for about 4 seconds during that time. The left engine vibration levels decreased after the event, below the levels previously recorded during the flight, and approximately to the level of the right engine vibration. The vibration and engine speed variations suggested separation of the left engine translating cowling at that point. The left engine thrust reverser deploy parameter remained in the ""Off"" state for the entire flight. Additionally, the FDR data revealed that the left engine vibration levels were elevated and left engine thrust reverser did not deploy on the two previous flights. The post accident inspection revealed that the left engine translating cowl had separated from the engine assembly and damaged the empennage. Damage to the thrust reverser components was consistent with prior operation with the reverser out of alignment and jamming of the translating structure.";21:23;Canadair CL-600-2B19 Regional Jet CRJ-200LR;null;Saturday 7 April 2007

The two pilots and four passengers were killed. The airplane was being operated by Marlin Air under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 135 and departed Milwaukee about 15:57 with an intended destination of Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP). At the time of the accident flight, marginal visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the surface, and instrument meteorological conditions prevailed aloft; the flight operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan.
The airplane was used to transport unspecified organs for transplant to a patient in Michigan. The pilot executed a climbing right turn to a northeast heading. The airplane's initial climb lasted for approximately one minute at which time the airplane levels off for approximately 16 seconds at a pressure altitude of 3,900 feet. The airplane then began another climb at about 1,300 feet per minute. This climb lasted for about 32 seconds at which time the airplane's pressure altitude was 4,400 feet. Radar data then showed the airplane in a descending left turn for the remaining 69 seconds of the data. The average descent rate during this period was 2,260 feet per minute. The airplane impacted the water of Lake Michigan approximately 243 knots indicated airspeed, 42 degrees nose down, and 115 degrees left wing down.
During the climb the crew declared an emergency and their intention to return to Milwaukee. During those communications, one of the flight crewmembers reported that they had experienced a runaway trim.";ca 16:00;Cessna 550 Citation II;Marlin Air;Monday 4 June 2007

The captain was the nonflying pilot for the flight, and the first officer was the flying pilot. The takeoff, climb, and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. At 14:37, as the flight approached the San Juan traffic area, the ATIS reported that winds were 060 degrees at 17 knots and gusting at 23 knots. Shortly thereafter, the captain briefed a Vref (the minimum approach airspeed in the landing configuration before the airplane reaches the runway threshold) of 95 knots and told the first officer to ""stand by for winds."" At 14:43 SJU Terminal Radar Approach Control cautioned the pilots of possible wake turbulence from a preceding Boeing. The captain told the first officer to slow down to about 140 kts. At 14:46, the local controller cleared the airplane to land on runway 08. The first officer turned the airplane left toward runway 08 and transitioned to the visual approach slope indicator. At 14:49, the captain stated, ""you better keep that nose down or get some power up because you're gonna balloon."" The airplane descended below the glideslope, causing a GPWS ""glideslope"" alert. The airplane was about 45 feet above ground level and traveling at 110 knots indicated airspeed when it crossed the runway 08 threshold. After the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the captain stated, ""power in a little bit, don't pull the nose up, don't pull the nose up."" At 14:49:39, the captain stated, ""you're ballooning,"" and the first officer replied, ""all right."" 
The airplane touched down for the first time about 14:49:41 and about 1,600 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold with vertical and lateral loads of about 1.3 Gs and -0.10 G, respectively. Upon touchdown the captain stated, ""get the power,"" and, 1 second later, ""my aircraft."" The first officer responded, ""your airplane."" The airplane had skipped to an altitude of about 4 feet and touched down again two seconds later about 2,200 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. The airplane then pitched up to an angle of 9° while climbing to an altitude of 37 feet and the engine torque increased from 10 to 43 percent. About 14:49:49, the pitch angle decreased to -3°, and the engine torque started to decrease to 20 percent with the pitch angle decreasing to -10°. The airplane touched down a third time about 14:49:51 at a bank angle of 7° left wing down and about 3,300 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold and with vertical and lateral loads of about 5 Gs and 0.85 G. The ATR pitched up again to 24 feet and landed a fourth time about 14:49:56 (about 15 seconds after the initial touchdown) and about 4,000 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. This time the airplane pitched down to -7° and that it was banked 29° left wing down. The airplane came to a complete stop on a grassy area about 217 feet left of the runway centerline and about 4,317 feet beyond the runway threshold.";14:50;ATR 72-212;null;Sunday 9 May 2004

The aircraft, a Beechcraft 1900D, was scheduled to depart Goose Bay Airport at 19:20 and arrive at the Gander at 20:54. The flight was operated by Exploits Valley Air Services.
Before departing, the captain checked the weather at Gander and the alternate airport, Deer Lake Airport (CYDF). The visibility at Gander was 1/8 statute miles (sm) in heavy snow.
The weather forecast for the time of arrival was wind 360° magnetic (M) at 35 knots, gusting to 55 knots; visibility 1/4 sm in heavy snow and blowing snow; vertical visibility 100 feet above ground level (agl). Starting at 22:30, the visibility was forecast to increase to 1/2 sm in moderate snow and blowing snow, and the vertical visibility was to improve to an overcast ceiling at 400 feet agl. A significant meteorological information (SIGMET) message was issued indicating severe turbulence below 3000 feet agl over an area of Newfoundland that included Gander.
The crew planned to conduct the instrument landing system with distance measuring equipment precision approach for runway 03 (ILS/DME RWY 03) at Gander. 
The captain called the company's acting operations manager to discuss the potential operational impact if the flight had to divert to its alternate. At first, the intent was to delay the flight for an hour to wait for the snowfall intensity to diminish and for the visibility to improve. However, after speaking with the acting operations manager, the captain decided to depart as scheduled, anticipating that the weather conditions would improve by the time they reached Gander. The crew was unaware that other carriers had cancelled their flights to Gander. 
The aircraft departed at 19:45 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. There were 14 passengers and 2 crew members on board. The first officer (F/O) was the pilot flying. While en route, the F/O indicated that he did not feel comfortable conducting the approach and landing due to his limited experience and the potential challenges associated with the anticipated weather conditions. The captain agreed to conduct the approach and landing.
During the flight, the crew received updated weather reports from both the Gander Area Control Centre and Gander Tower, which indicated an increase in visibility from 1/8 sm to 1/2 sm and a reduction in the snowfall intensity from heavy to light. The crew decided that the visibility was sufficient to conduct the approach as initially planned. The winds and blowing snow were not identified as concerns.
While the flight was en route, snow removal was in progress at Gander. The airport plows were focused on clearing the middle 120 feet of the 200-foot-wide runway. The plows had pushed the snow into windrows along both sides of the runway, about 60 feet from the centreline.
The crew contacted the tower controller for the runway surface condition report. The latest runway condition report for runway 03, taken at 2044, was as follows: 120 feet cleared width, 40% dry snow with a depth of 0.13 inches and 60% bare and dry; remaining width 100% dry snow with a depth of 4 inches; remarks - windrows along reported width with a depth of 10 inches.
The snowplows continued plowing the runway until about 21:10, at which point they began to plow a path for the aircraft to follow from the runway to the apron.
On the approach, about 12 minutes before touchdown, the aircraft began to encounter moderate turbulence through 5700 feet above sea level. This turbulence continued until landing and was significant enough that the passengers were experiencing discomfort.
Once the aircraft intercepted the localizer, control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain as planned. The landing gear was lowered and the flaps were set to full, as per the company's standard operating procedures.
At 21:24, the tower controller cleared flight 7804 to land and provided the crew with the current tower winds of 360°M at 36 knots, gusting to 44 knots. The crew acquired the runway approach lighting at about 800 feet agl, more than 2 nautical miles (nm) from the threshold.
At approximately 21:30, while on short final, the crew asked for a wind update. The tower controller informed the crew that the tower winds were currently unavailable and provided the last aerodrome special meteorological report (SPECI), which had been taken 18 minutes before. The SPECI indicated that the winds were 350°M at 29 knots, gusting to 41 knots.
In the landing flare, the captain asked the F/O to call out the heights on the radar altimeter to help them determine how high they were above the ground. Almost immediately, the 10- and 0-foot calls were made. There was no indication that the crew lost visual contact with the runway edge lighting.
At about 21:30, the aircraft touched down on its main landing gear (MLG) to the right of the centreline at a normal descent rate and in a relatively flat attitude about 2800 feet from the threshold. The crew was unaware how far to the right of the centreline they were when they touched down. Almost immediately, the aircraft veered to the right when the right-side MLG encountered snow. The nose landing gear (NLG) struck the windrow of compacted snow, which caused the NLG to collapse. As the aircraft's nose began to drop, the propeller blades struck the snow and runway surface. All of the left-side propeller blades and 3 of the right-side propeller blades separated at the blade root. A portion of a blade tip from the right-side propeller penetrated the cabin wall at floor level.
The aircraft slid down the runway, with the nose coming within 27 feet of the runway edge, before crossing back through the windrow toward the centreline.
The aircraft came to a stop about 14 seconds after touchdown on a heading of about 350°M. The nose was about 15 feet to the right of the centreline and 3400 feet from the threshold.
Once the aircraft came to a stop, the F/O opened the cabin door and evacuated the passengers. The captain shut down the engines. The tower controller did not have any ground radar and was unaware that the aircraft was stopped on the runway. The captain contacted the tower controller to report the situation and request assistance. The tower controller immediately activated the crash bell.
The first fire truck left the station within 1 minute of the crash bell being activated. About 2 minutes later, the plow drivers, who were cross-trained as fire rescue personnel, drove the remaining 2 fire trucks and the rescue vehicle to the aircraft.
Because the location of the aircraft was not known, the vehicles started at the north end of runway 03. They proceeded cautiously because of the reduced visibility from blowing snow and because the passengers were out on the runway. The first fire truck arrived at the aircraft about 6 minutes after the accident. In total, 3 fire trucks, 1 rescue vehicle, and 2 pickup trucks responded.
Once the firefighters established that there was no fire, the rescue vehicle and pickup trucks started transporting passengers to the terminal. Within 25 minutes of the crash bell being activated, all passengers and crew had been transported to the terminal. Three passengers sustained minor injuries. None of the injuries were attributed to the portion of the propeller blade that had penetrated the cabin.";21:30;Beechcraft 1900D;null;Wednesday 20 April 2016

The crew had carried out the sector from Hong Kong to Surabaya on the previous day. The accident aircraft stayed overnight at Surabaya Airport and was parked at Stand 8.
The accident aircraft uplifted 24,400 kilogram (kg) of fuel and was prepared for departure. The flight was airborne at 08:24 local time. During the climb, the flight crew noticed some abnormal Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) fluctuations on No. 2 engine, with a range of approximately ± 0.015 around EPR target. No. 1 engine also had abnormal EPR fluctuations but within a narrower range.
At 08:58, shortly after levelling off at FL390, an ECAM message ""ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT"" was annunciated. ECAM information ""ENG 2 SLOW RESPONSE"" was shown for crew awareness. After consulting with a maintenance engineer, it was decided to continue since all engine parameters were considered normal other than the EPR fluctuations.
Almost two hours into the flight, the same ECAM message appeared, with an additional information message ""AVOID RAPID THR CHANGES"". The engine anti-ice was selected on for both engines, but this had not effect. The crew then again contacted a maintenance engineer, who told them that he had seen these EPR fluctuations before and that the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) of engine no. 2 would be replaced after landing.
Nearing the destination, the crew began to prepare for a runway 07L arrival. According to recent weather information, significant windshear was forecast for both runway 07L and 07R.
At 13:19 hrs local time during the descent to a cleared level of FL230, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT"" and ""ENG 2 STALL"" were annunciated within a short period of time. According to the Commander, a light ""pop"" sound was heard and some ""ozone"" and ""burning"" smell was detected shortly before the ECAM message ""ENG 2 STALL"". At that time the flight was at about 110 nautical miles southeast of Hong Kong, and was descending through FL300 with a Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) of 295 kt. Vertical mode ""Open Descent"" was selected. The flight crew completed the necessary ECAM actions and set No. 2 thrust lever accordingly to IDLE position. ECAM information ""ENG 1 SLOW RESPONSE"" and ""AVOID RAPID THRUST CHANGES"" were also annunciated. No. 1 thrust lever was advanced to Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) position as per the ""SINGLE ENGINE OPERATIONS"" strategy stated in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). However No. 1 engine N1 only temporary increased to about 57% N1 and then dropped back to about 37% N1 at 13:21 hrs.
At 13:21 hrs, the flight crew declared ""PAN PAN"" to Hong Kong Radar and advised that No. 2 engine was operating at idle thrust. The crew made the request to shorten the track for a priority landing. Hong Kong Radar then cleared the flight to proceed directly to waypoint ""LIMES"". 
At about 13:26 hrs, the Commander took control of the aircraft as the PF in accordance with Cathay standard operating procedures for one engine inoperative and the co-pilot became the Pilot Monitoring.
At 13:30 hrs, when the aircraft was approximately 45 nm southeast from Hong Kong and was about to level off at 8,000 ft AMSL, ECAM message ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated. The CAS at that moment was about 295 kt. ECAM actions were carried out by the flight crew and No. 1 thrust lever was put to IDLE position accordingly. Autothrust (A/THR) was disengaged and both engine master switches remained at the ""ON"" position. With both thrust levers at IDLE position, the Commander then tested the controllability of the engines by moving the thrust levers one at a time. There were no thrust changes corresponding to the engine lever movements initially. At 13:32 hrs, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated again.
At 13:32 hrs, the crew declared ""MAYDAY"" and advised Hong Kong Approach of the double engine stall situation. CPA780 was then cleared to descend to 3,000 ft AMSL. At that time, the aircraft was still in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and the CAS was at about 233 kt and reducing. At around the same time, the Commander disconnected the Autopilot and the Flight Directors (FD) and flew the aircraft manually. The altitude increased from 6,760 ft to 7,164 ft AMSL with the CAS reducing and the aircraft started to descend again when the CAS decreased to about 200 kt. 
When the aircraft was on base leg during the approach, the flight crew reported that they were flying in VMC.
The crew moved the thrust levers to check the engine control but there was no direct response from the engines. The No. 1 engine speed eventually increased to about 74% N1 with the No. 1 thrust lever in the CLB (climb) detent position. The No. 2 engine speed remained at sub-idle about 17% N1, with the No. 2 thrust lever at the IDLE position. 
At 13:37 hrs, the ATC made both runways 07L and 07R available for CPA780. During the descent and approach, there were a number of other ECAM warning messages announced in the cockpit which were not relevant to the engine control problem. 
The flight crew carried out the ""ENG ALL ENG FLAMEOUT - FUEL REMAINING"" checklist in the QRH for No. 2 engine in an attempt to clear the thrust control fault of that engine. As per the checklist, the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) was deployed manually, APU bleed was selected ""ON"" and No. 2 engine MASTER switch was set to ""OFF"" then ""ON"" at 13:38 hrs. However, No. 2 engine remained at a sub-idle speed of 17% N1.
At 13:38 hrs, Flap CONF 1 was selected. At 13:39 hrs, when CPA780 was at 5,524 ft AMSL, a CAS at 219 kt and a distance of nine nm from the airport, the Commander tried to decrease the speed by retarding the No. 1 thrust lever. However, there was no corresponding decrease in No. 1 engine speed. Eventually, No. 1 thrust lever was left at the IDLE position and No. 1 engine speed remained at 74% N1.
At 13:40 hrs, Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 for a visual approach for Runway 07L. Flight crew deployed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 5,216 ft AMSL descending with a CAS of 234 kt at around 8 nm from the runway. Flight crew selected landing gear down shortly afterwards.
The Commander aimed to fly the aircraft at a CAS as close as possible to the Minimum Selectable Speed (VLS), which was 158 kt at that time. The aircraft went through the runway extended centreline and recaptured the centreline from the north in order to manage altitude and airspeed. 
At around 13:41 hrs, with the Maximum Allowable Speed (Vmax) at 240 kt and actual CAS at 244 kt, an overspeed warning was generated by the onboard system. A short while later Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 to land on runway 07L and advised that the current surface wind was 150 degrees at 13 kt. Flight crew stowed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 984 ft AMSL and armed the ground spoilers at 816 ft AMSL.
At 13:42 hrs, when CPA780 was still at flap CONF 1, with a CAS of 227 kt and a vertical speed of 1,216 ft per min at an altitude of 732 ft AMSL and at about two nm to touchdown, the warning ""Too Low Terrain"" was generated by the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS). Flap CONF 2 was selected at around one nm to touchdown with a CAS of 234 kt and at an altitude of 548 ft AMSL. A flashing ""F RELIEF"" message was displayed at Engine Warning Display (EWD) as the TE flap was extended to 8-degree position instead of the commanded 14-degree position. With a Vmax of 205 kt, another overspeed warning was generated shortly after Flap 2 selection. The ""Too Low Terrain"" warning changed to ""Pull Up"" warning briefly at 176 ft AMSL and back to ""Too Low Terrain"" within a very short timeframe. The EGPWS warning stopped at 24 ft above the ground.
During the final approach, No. 1 engine speed decreased to about 70% N1 at touchdown, with the No. 1 thrust lever at IDLE position. No. 2 engine speed remained at about 17% N1 throughout the final approach and landing.
CPA780 touched down on runway 07L at 13:43 hrs at a position between abeam Taxiways A4 and A5 and with a distance of around 680 metres (m) from the beginning of the runway threshold at a ground speed of 231 kt. The landing weight was approximately 173,600 kg. The landing wind was 143 degrees at 14 kt. Immediately after both main gears touched down on the runway, the right main gear bounced and the aircraft became airborne again briefly. The aircraft then rolled left seven degrees and pitched down to -2.5 degrees at the second touchdown during which, the lower cowling of No. 1 engine contacted the runway surface. Spoilers deployed automatically. Both engine thrust reversers were selected by the Commander. Only No. 1 engine thrust reverser was deployed successfully and ECAM message ""ENG 2 REV FAULT"" was annunciated. Maximum manual braking was applied. As required by the company procedure for the purpose of drawing the PF’s attention in the status of the deceleration devices, the co-pilot called out ""no spoilers, no REV green, no DECEL"" during the landing roll.
The aircraft came to a complete stop on the runway at a position just passed Taxiway A10, with its nose wheel at about 309 m from the end of Runway 07L. The total distance for stopping the aircraft from the initial touchdown was approximately 2,630 m.
The crew shut down the engines and requested the tower controller to check for a possible wheel fire. There was no sign of fire. An emergency evacuation was then ordered just after 13:45.

Before they knew it, the windscreen turned dark brown and several loud thuds were heard. Both engines began to lose power and there was a burning smell. The captain took over control of the flight. They radioed ATC about their emergency situation: ""Aaah, this is Cactus 1549. We lost thrust in both engines. We are turning back toward LaGuardia."" It quickly became evident that they were not able to reach LaGuardia. A possible landing at the Teterboro Airport (TEB) was considered. The captain decided that they would not be able to land safely on the short runway in the middle of a built-up area. The flight descended over the Hudson River until it ditched.
All occupants evacuated the airplane, climbing onto the wing and entering escape slides. Coast Guard vessels and commuter ferries rescued everyone on board.

This was the operator's inaugural scheduled regular public transport service to Kosrae and Pohnpei.
Travelling on-board were the Nauruan President, the Nauruan Minister of Aviation, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nauru Air Corporation. In the six weeks preceding this flight, the operator had flown three charter flights to the FSM airports. The captain also stated that he had flown a couple of charter flights (during the day) into Kosrae before this inaugural scheduled service.
The flight was originally scheduled to leave Nauru at 02:30 UTC (14:30 Nauru Time). However, a technical issue with the original aircraft led to a change to VH-NLK. This resulted in the aircraft departing 60 minutes late. 
The sector from the Marshall Islands to Kosrae was delayed a further 17 minutes due to ground handling issues. The flight departed after last light at 07:40 and the planned flight time was 1 hour 19 minutes. The approach and landing at Kosrae was at night.
For this sector, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring.
During the climb to the planned cruising altitude of FL360, in accordance with standard procedures, the flight crew selected the standard atmospheric pressure of 1013 hPa on the altimeters.
The flight crew stated that, prior to commencing the descent for Kosrae, they obtained the weather and the local QNH. The weather had deteriorated from that forecast. The flight crew also stated that, during the descent and approach, the local flight information service radio operator provided a considerable number of weather updates on the local airport conditions at Kosrae. Visibility was around 3 NM, rain showers were in the area with low cloud and wind 'pretty much straight down the strip for (runway) 05'. The captain, as pilot flying, conducted the briefing for the non-directional beacon (NDB)/distance measuring equipment (DME) approach to runway 05. The captain stated that, at this time, they had made special mention of the unusually low transition level of FL 55. The captain stated that at most airports they operated into, the transition level was between FL 110 and FL 130. The crew then completed the descent checklist. They had decided that, based on the expected weather conditions, they would make two approach attempts, and if they could not land, would divert to Nauru Airport, the nominated alternate airport. Prior to descending below the transition level, the crew did not complete the approach checklist, which consisted of one item: set the altimeters to the local QNH and crosscheck them. Leaving the altimeters' subscale set to the standard atmospheric pressure setting of 1013 hPa, and not setting the subscale to the local barometric pressure of 1007 hPa, resulted in the indicated altitude over-reading, such that when the altimeter indicated 500 ft, the aircraft's actual altitude was about 320 ft above the mean sea level.
At about 08:56, the aircraft passed overhead the NDB at 5,000 ft, and continued the descent, tracking outbound on a heading of 300°, to about 10 NM from the NDB (10 DME). The flight crew were controlling the aircraft through the auto-flight systems, with an autopilot and the autothrottle engaged. At this point, the crew turned the aircraft left, and at 09:01, the aircraft intercepted the inbound track to the NDB at about 1,800 ft. The crew selected the landing gear down at 1,500 ft, and flap 15 at 1,250 ft.
The crew stated that they established visual contact with the runway as the aircraft passed through 900 ft indicated altitude, about 5 NM from the DME. At about 740 ft indicated altitude, the crew selected flap 25. The crew elected to delay selection of the nominated landing flap of 40 degrees until they made positive visual contact with the runway. They did not subsequently select flap 40 on that approach.
As the aircraft descended to the minimum descent altitude for the approach of 500 ft, the captain selected the altitude hold (ALT HOLD) mode to level the aircraft at 500 ft indicated altitude. At 09:03:13, an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) alert sounded, and lasted for 5 seconds. The aircraft was over water, at 368 ft radio altitude. The crew reported that they were in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) at night, with the runway lights in sight. The crew stated that, at the time, they believed the EGPWS alert was due to a 'map shift' in the aircraft's navigation position. The flight crew selected 'terrain inhibit', which cancelled the current EGPWS TCF alert. The crew were not aware that the EGPWS had its own internal GPS.
At 09:03:19, the aircraft was at 4.31 DME, 480 ft indicated altitude and 340 ft radio altitude, and descending at about 313 fpm, when the EGPWS TCF alert again sounded, and lasted for 12 seconds. The aircraft maintained 480 ft indicated altitude for about 12 seconds, before descending again.
The crew reported losing visual reference with the runway when the aircraft was about 3 NM from the DME. In response to losing visual reference, the captain disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and pressed the take-off/go-around (TOGA) switches on the thrust levers. At this time the recorded aircraft pitch angle was 9.5°. The flight data recorder data showed that TOGA was selected at 09:03:47, at 448 ft indicated altitude, or 304 ft radio altitude, and the aircraft was about 3.5 NM from the DME. At this time, the aircraft's computed airspeed reduced to 129 kt.
The captain stated that he pressed the TOGA switches on the thrust levers once. In the Flight Director engaged go-around mode, one TOGA switch press results in a reduced thrust autothrottle setting, and two presses of the TOGA switch advances the autothrottle to full go-around thrust. The crew stated that the aircraft pitch angle was initially raised to 15°, however, the captain observed the airspeed decay and pitched the aircraft down to increase the airspeed. The first officer stated he called 'sink rate' twice. The captain then realised and rectified the situation, depressing the TOGA switch a second time commanding full go-around thrust.
At 09:03:53, the aircraft was at 3.3 DME, and the third EGPWS TCF alert sounded, which lasted for 10 seconds. The aircraft was then at 384 ft indicated altitude, or 244 ft radio altitude, and descended 5 seconds later to its lowest radio altitude of 200 ft before climbing.
At 09:04:04, the flaps were retracted to 15° and the aircraft reached its maximum pitch up angle of 16°. Two seconds later, the flaps were retracted to 10°. From the time the captain set the thrust to TOGA until the aircraft was stabilised on the missed approach path (at about 09:05), the recorded aircraft pitch angle varied from -0.35° to +16°.
When the aircraft was established on the missed approach heading, the captain continued a climb to 4,000 ft. After stabilising the aircraft in the missed approach, the crew identified that the altimeters were still set to 1013 hPa and corrected them to the local area QNH. After repositioning overhead, the NDB at 4,000 ft, the crew then conducted a second approach and the aircraft landed at Kosrae without further incident.";20:03;Boeing 737-33A;Nauru Airlines;Friday 12 June 2015

The airplane was based at Kandahar and operated by the US Air Force on a combat intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission.
The airplane, callsign Independence 08, departed Kandahar at 11:57 and entered orbit at 12:29. Upon entering the operating area about 12:29, they encountered a cloud deck partially covering their orbit area and a large, rapidly building towering cumulous cloud in the center of their orbit area from 17,000 ft to 24,000 ft mean sea level (MSL).
The towering cumulus clouds began to grow and drift into the airplane's orbit, prompting a request to climb from 20,000 ft to 23,000 ft. This translates to climbing from 13,800 to 16,800 ft above ground level.
The airplane was in a left hand orbit, preparing to shift the orbit, when the pilot initiated the climb with the autopilot on at 12:40:40.
While or just after initiating the climb, the pilot continued working an orbit adjustment to better service tracking an active target, and approximately ten seconds after the climb was initiated, the climb rate increased. Fifteen seconds afterward the pilot noticed he had allowed the airspeed to decrease during the climb, stating, ""A little slow, correcting."" Seven seconds later, the mission commander in the right hand seat said, ""Alright, firewall,"" meaning to advance the throttles as far forward as they would go, and one second later, the auto-pilot was disengaged.
The propellers on the MC-12W do not counter-rotate, and advancing the power in the MC-12W produces left-handed torque and P-factor, creating a left yaw and making the aircraft to want to turn left; the airplane was already in a left-hand turn and left bank. Two seconds after calling to ""firewall"" the throttles, and one second after auto-pilot disengagement, the bank angle warning tone sounded, indicating the left bank had rapidly increased to greater than 50 degrees. The mission commander again called for full power, and four seconds later, he directed ""eyes inside,"" telling the pilot to refer to his instruments for attitude and airspeed information; contemporaneously, the stall warning sounded. The stall warning horn stopped after five seconds, and a second later, background noise indicates items began flying around within the cockpit and the bank angle warning stopped. The pilot stated: ""Whoa, pull up"".
The mission commander then advised the pilot to look at his airspeed and took over the aircraft, calling for a reduction in power. Four seconds after the mission commander took the aircraft, the aircraft overspeed warning sounded, followed by the landing gear horn sounding. The landing gear horn indicates the throttles were reduced toward idle, and it did not sound until 15 seconds after initial stall warning sounded. The MA reached a maximum recorded height of 20,900 ft. and lost approximately 15,000 ft before impacting the ground.
The airplane impacted with the fuselage slightly nose-low, in a left bank, with minimal forward momentum. The airplane was destroyed upon impact and burned during the post-crash fire .";12:43;Beechcraft MC-12W Liberty (King Air 350);United States Air Force - USAF;Saturday 27 April 2013

The pilot reduced the IAS to 250 knots and maneuvered the aircraft to the east of track to avoid these cells when he experienced light turbulence as the aircraft passed abeam the cells. Approximately 10 nm after passing the cells, the pilot experienced a severe updraft with the aircraft climbing between 1500 to
2000 feet/min at FL200 an IAS of 230 knots. During the updraft however, the pilot encountered severe turbulence followed by very large hailstones for approximately 30 seconds. The aircraft then flew into VMC conditions after approximately 1 minute. According to the pilot, the Radar showed no returns to indicate any hail. The aircraft landed safely at Johannesburg without any further incident. No injuries were sustained to the crew or passengers. The aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair due to hail damage.

The aircraft had been chartered by the University of Michigan Basketball team for a flight to a game in Washington, DC.
The flight crew prepared for take-off and calculated V-speeds (V1, VR, V2) using ""Normal Thrust Takeoff"", a 10 kts headwind, and a take-off weight of 146,600 lbs. The V-speeds for this configuration were 139 kts, 142 kts, and 150 kts, respectively. However, the flight crew chose to increase VR to 150 kts to allow for more control during take-off in the presence of windshear.
During takeoff roll, at 14:51:56 (about 3,000 ft down the runway) and about 138 kts of airspeed, the control column was pulled back slightly from a non-dimensional value of -7 to -5.52. The airplane’s left elevator followed the control input and moved from a position of -15° trailing edge down to -13° trailing edge down. The right elevator did not change and stayed at approximately -16° trailing edge down. At 14:52:01 a large control column input was made (151 kts and 4100 ft down the runway) to a non-dimensional 18.5 and the left elevator moves to a position near 15° trailing edge up. After 14:52:05 the right elevator moves to -13° trailing edge down, but no more. The airplane does not respond in pitch and does not rotate. The captain decided to abort the takeoff.
The maximum groundspeed was 163 kts (173 kts airspeed) and the airplane began to decelerate as soon as the brakes were applied at 14:52:08. Spoilers were deployed at 14:52:10 and thrust reversers were deployed between 14:52:13 and 14:52:15. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway. The airplane’s ground speed was 100 kts when it left the paved surface.
The aircraft overran the end of the runway, damaged approach lights, went through the perimeter fence and crossed Tyler Road.
It came to rest on grassy terrain, 345 meters past the end of the runway, with the rear fuselage across a ditch. The nose landing gear had collapsed. 
Runway 23L is a 7543 ft long runway.

Post-accident examination by the NTSB revealed movement of the control column in the cockpit appeared normal; the control columns were free to move, and the elevator control tabs moved as commanded. However, when investigators tried to move the elevator surfaces by hand, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator was jammed in a trailing edge-down position (airplane nose down). Upon further inspection, the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage was found damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand.
Examination of the flight data recorder data indicates that during the taxi and take-off roll, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator did not move. During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots.
Review of previous flight data showed normal movement of both the left and right elevator surfaces.  The airplane flew to Ypsilanti two days before the accident.";14:52;McDonnell Douglas MD-83;Ameristar Jet Charter;Wednesday 8 March 2017

The aircraft departed Dhaka, Bangladesh at 12:52 hours local time (06:52 UTC), with 67 passengers and four crew members on board. The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of FL240 and proceeded towards Kathmandu. At the time of arrival near Kathmandu a thunderstorm was passing the airport with cumulonimbus clouds passing at 2500ft. 
The aircraft was cleared for an approach to runway 02. Apparently the approach was aborted and the flight crew radioed that they were performing a right hand orbit. Initially the air traffic controller replied that they could not land in the opposite direction (runway 20) because other traffic on finals. The controller requested approaching traffic to hold and asked flight 211 if they wanted to land on runway 02 or 20. The flight crew replied: ""we like to land on two-zero"". The flight was then cleared to land on runway 20 with wind reported at 260 degrees, 6 knots. Initially the flight crew did not have the runway in sight, but the flight then radioed: ""Affirmative, we have [...] runway in sight, requesting to land, Sir"". The flight was again cleared to land. The pilot read back: ""cleared to land runway 02"", though clearance had been given for runway 20 initially. The air traffic controller then also read back the clearance for runway 02.
The aircraft touched down at about 1700 meters down the threshold and on the left portion of centerline of runway 20. The aircraft then ran off the left side of the runway, ran through the inner perimeter fence of the airport area, moved down along rough down slope and finally stopped at about 442 meters southeast from its initial touchdown point.

The intention was then to fly from Rumbek Aerodrome to Lokichoggio in Kenya. During the VFR flight to Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew experienced a north-easterly wind with extremely turbulent conditions.
Prior to landing at Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew calculated the approach and landing indicated air speeds (IAS) to be 85 kts and 75 kts respectively. The crew then joined the circuit accordingly for landing on runway 01. Approximately 4 nm away from landing, the co-pilot warned the pilot-in-command of a whirlwind in the area, close to the threshold of runway 01.
The whirlwind appeared to have dissipated and the pilot-in-command continued with the landing with full flaps. At approximately 100 ft above ground level and 100 m before the threshold of runway 01, the IAS suddenly decreased to 70 kts. The pilot-in-command said that he immediately selected full power in order to arrest the rate of descent as wind shear in Southern Sudan and especially at Rumbek at this time of the year was a common factor. The aircraft nevertheless continued to descend and the left-hand propeller and left-hand main landing gear collided with a tree approximately 20 m before the threshold of runway 01. The tree was approximately 6 ft high and on an embankment. The aircraft then struck a drainage ditch before the threshold, causing the left-hand main landing gear to collapse. The aeroplane bounced and landed on the runway. The co-pilot immediately retracted the flaps and the aircraft continued down the runway on the right-hand main landing gear, but as its speed decayed, the left-hand propeller impacted with the runway surface. The aircraft veered to the left off the runway and entered a drainage ditch parallel to the runway. Both left and right-hand main landing gear were torn out of their attachment points and the aircraft eventually came to rest on its lower fuselage section. 
The crew and passengers sustained no injuries and evacuated the aircraft safely through the emergency exits and rear main entry door.
The aircraft was substantially damaged: both left and right-hand main landing gear were damaged; the left-hand outboard aileron was forced out of the outboard hinge point, and the lower fuselage frame and attachment stringers subsequently collapsed and were damaged.

The flight departed from the Philadelphia International Airport, Pennsylvania, about 15:04 on a repositioning flight destined for Teterboro (TEB).
The captain filed an IFR flight plan to TEB planning a 28-minute flight at a cruising altitude of flight level 270 (27,000 feet) with a cruise speed of 441 knots and a departure time of 14:30.""After departure about 15:04, the flight was cleared to climb to 4,000 feet above mean sea level (msl). The flight reached a maximum altitude of 4,000 feet msl. About 15:15, the flight was cleared to descend to 3,000 ft msl. The New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) cleared the flight for the TEB ILS Runway 6 Approach, circle to land runway 1.
TRACON instructed the flight to switch frequencies and contact TEB air traffic control (ATC) about 9 miles from the airport; however, the flight did not check onto the ATC's frequency until 4 miles from the airport. ATC cleared the flight to land on runway 1 and issued the TEB winds of 320 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 32 knots.
Radar track data indicated that the flight did not start its right circling turn until it was less than 1 mile from the approach end of runway 6. According to TEB ATC, aircraft typically start the right turn at the final approach fix for runway 6, which is located 3.8 nm from the approach end of runway 6. 
A TEB ATC controller reported that he observed the airplane bank hard to the right and he could see the belly of the airplane with the wings almost perpendicular to the ground. The airplane then appeared to level out for just a second or two before the left wing dropped, showing the entire top of the airplane. The aircraft then descended and impacted the ground in a right wing low and nose down attitude in an industrial area between Kero Road and Commerce Road in Carlstadt, New Jersey, 1000 m short of runway 01. A fire erupted and consumed the aircraft. Both crew members have died in the accident.

The Cockpit Voice Recorder readout showed that the first officer was Pilot Flying from the takeoff up until the moment the aircraft started the procedure circle prior to landing. At that time the first officer stated in a strained voice: ""I'm gonna give ya your controls okay?"". 
Based on the internal designations for new or low-time pilots within Trans-Pacific Jets, the first officer was not allowed to act as Pilot Flying.";15:29;Learjet 35A;null;Monday 15 May 2017

The airplane was operated by Phoenix Aviation and chartered by Expo Aviation. Using GPS and DME the airplane approached Colombo. The approach controller cleared flight 3002 to descend to FL150. After reaching that altitude the navigator passed on the QNH and QFE values for Colombo: 1009 mb and 756 mm Hg. The altimeters were updated with this information. However, the copilot erroneously programmed 765 mm Hg into the altimeter. After turning left onto finals the aircraft, 14 km from the runway, descended to an altitude above sea level of 60 meters. The airplane descended slowly until the landing gear contacted the surface of the sea at a distance of 10,7 km short of runway 04. Climb power was applied and the navigator reported that they were going around: ""PHG 3-0-0-2 go around, again I call you established localizer"". At a height of 60-90 meters however, the captain decided to continue the approach. Assuming the undercarriage had been substantially damaged, he decided to carry out a belly landing on the side of the runway.

The captain and first officer were not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. Bright night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the scheduled flight. 
The captain was the pilot flying (PF), and the first officer was the non-flying pilot (PNF). The flight crew briefed a high (ELP elevation 3,958 feet msl), hot (approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit), and heavy departure (TOGW 297,000 pounds; 375,880 MTOGW), as well as an engine-out departure procedure. The flight crew completed the taxi-out and pre-departure checklist without any anomalies and entered the V-speeds (V1 was 139 knots and Vr was approximately 143 knots.) into the flight management system (FMS). Both crewmember's primary flight display (PFD) displayed the V-speeds with the standard blue lines with no discrepancies noted. The PF entered the V2 speed (approximately 143 knots) into the flight control computer in the glare shield and entered 250 knots for the extended speed to 10,000 feet msl. The PNF did not recall being distracted during the checklist or before takeoff procedures. The flight crew requested and was cleared for departure on runway 04. 
The PF aligned the airplane on the runway and applied standard takeoff power. The fight instruments were cross-checked at 80 knots (PNF called out 80 knots) and the V-speeds were correctly displayed on the PFD. The PNF checked the engine diagnostic page to observe the #2 engine vibrations. According to the PNF, when he looked back at the PFD, the V-speeds were not displayed, and V2 had reset to 100 knots. According to company personnel, the PNF did not look at the speed index (correct raw speed data) on the left side of the PFD. The PNF called ""V1 rotate,"" and the PF responded by establishing an aircraft pitch of approximately 12 degrees. The PF realized the airplane was not climbing or accelerating properly, and the PNF realized the airspeed was approximately 120-125 knots (below V2), called for the PF to lower the nose of the airplane. The captain [PF] lowered the nose, determined the best and safest course of action was to reject the takeoff, and executed a rejected takeoff by pulling the throttles to idle. The flight control computer automatically applied maximum auto brakes, the airplane slowed, and the PF taxied the airplane off the runway at high-speed taxiway P.

FedEx maintenance personnel and the ARFF personnel observed two tires had deflated during the rejected takeoff. The airplane was taxied to the ramp for maintenance repairs. The next morning, the first officer found evidence of a tail strike during the walk-around inspection.

On approach to runway 10, the captain and first officer discussed approach and landing considerations due to the strong crosswinds, and it was decided that the first officer would continue the approach. Immediately prior to landing, the first officer experienced difficulty, so control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain. The transfer of control was completed less than 2 seconds prior to landing. The aircraft touched down on the left main wheel, bounced, and landed hard on the nosewheel; the nose landing gear collapsed due to overstress failures. Directional control was lost, and the aircraft skidded on its nose and came to rest 96 feet off the north side of the runway. There were no injuries, and the aircraft was substantially damaged.

The investigation determined that, when control of the aircraft was passed to the captain, there was insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing due to the substantial crosswind. The Air Labrador Twin Otter standard operating procedures (SOPs) do not state when the captain should permit the first officer to act as pilot flying or relieve the first officer from that role. When allowing the first officer to fly in challenging conditions, the captain must be prepared to take control of the aircraft in adequate time to ensure the safety of the flight. Also, there is an increased risk of a landing accident if a required briefing is not conducted.

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-700, originated from New York-La Guardia Airport at 10:43 for a flight to Dallas-Love Field, Texas. About 11:04, when the aircraft was climbing through FL325, the no.1 engine (CFM56-7B24) suffered an uncontained failure. The flight crew noticed that the no.1 engine rpm dropped to zero, as did the oil pressure. The cabin altitude horn sounded and the aircraft experienced a sudden, uncommanded, left roll of a 41° bank angle. The pilots leveled the wing, donned their oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent. The flight crew then requested air traffic control to give them vectors to the nearest suitable airport.
As a result of the uncontained failure, a fan blade and parts of the engine cowling and engine air inlet cowl had separated. Debris impacted a window frame of row 14, causing the window and frame to break away. This resulted in a decompression of the aircraft. Additional debris impacted and damaged the leading edge of the left hand wing.
The flight was vectored towards Philadelphia Airport, where the crew requested an extended final approach due to concerns of aircraft controllability. It was decided to land with flaps 5 for that reason, and an approach speed of 165 knots. The aircraft landed on runway 27L at 11:19 hours and the aircraft was stopped on a taxiway.

All 196 on board and seven persons on the ground were killed.
The aircraft, an Airbus A300B4-622R, originated from Denpasar Airport, Indonesia and was bound for Taipei. The flight was cleared for an ILS/DME runway 05L approach to Taipei Chiang Kai Shek Airport in light rain and fog. The aircraft remained high on the approach. At 1,2nm short of the threshold, the altitude was 1515 feet, whereas it should have been at 500 feet at that point.
The flight crew selected full flaps. At 20:04:50 hours local time the autopilot was disconnected. Subsequently, as the aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 1475 feet, go around thrust was applied.
The aircraft rapidly pitched up, reaching +35° as it climbed trough 1723 feet at an airspeed of 134 knots. The gear had just been raised and the flaps set to 20 degrees.
At 20:05:16 the aircraft had reached 2327 feet at a +42.7° pitch. Nine seconds later the speed had fallen to 43 knots as the aircraft stalled. The aircraft nosed down with a 79° left bank. The flight crew was not able to regain control and the aircraft impacted the ground left of the runway. It hit a utility pole and a highway median and then skidded into several houses, surrounded by fish farms, rice paddies, factories and warehouses. A fire erupted. 
Visibility at the time of the accident was 2400 feet, the runway 05L RVR (runway visual range) was 3900 feet, 300 feet broken ceiling, 3000 feet overcast.";20:05;Airbus A300B4-622R;China Airlines;Monday 16 February 1998

The mishap flight was a chartered flight to tranpsort personnel of Pakistan Petroleum Limited from Karachi to Sui. The takeoff weight was within limits. The calculated V1 and V2 speeds were 104 Kts and 106 Kts respectively, whereas the stalling speed was 84 Kts. The captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and the first officer was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for this sector. However, the first officer was a qualified captain on Beechcraft 1900D aircraft.
The aircraft taxied out at 08:05 hours local time. The aircraft start up and taxiing was normal.
The flight was given runway 25L for takeoff and the aircraft lined up on the runway. After obtaining takeoff clearance, the flight crew completed pre take off checks with no abnormalities observed.
At 08:23:06, take off thrust was applied very gradually and the aircraft started to roll. Five seconds after reaching maximum power, at 08:23:35 the PM announced the speed being 80 kts. FDR data indicated an increasing trend in torque and drop in propeller rpm of engine no. 2, which was not monitored by the flight crew. The propeller rpm dropped to a minimum 709 rpm in the next 11 seconds. Also, torque of engine no.1 began to drop, without any significant change in rpm. The aircraft was still rolling for takeoff and accellerating through 95 kts. When the no. 2 engine propeller rpm started to drop, the PF announced that the aircraft began drifting towards the right. The PM replied ""continue...continue"".
At 08:23:44 when the aircraft was reaching 96 kts, the PM asked PF to turn left and apply left rudder. 
The flight crew did not realize at this stage that there was a problem with both engines and they were still below V1 which, as per pre flight calculation, was 104 kts. 
At 08:23:49 the first officer asked the captain to increase the power of the left engine. By this time the drop in no. 1 engine torque had been arrested. It appears that the first officer had a glance on torque indicator and asked the captain to increase power. 
At 08:23:53 the captain glanced at the engine instruments and wanted to express his concern about loss of power. Before being able the first officer announced ‘V1...rotate’ at 08:23:55 and 101 kts of speed.
After getting airborne, the aircraft continued to drift towards the right. In order to control the dropping speed and direction loss, the first officer took over the controls.
At 08:24:08 when decreasing speed had reached 98 kts the first officer asked the captain to raise the landing gears in order to reduce drag and gain speed. The aircraft had climbed to approximately 39 feet above ground and the captain asked the first officer to lower the nose in order to gain speed. At 08:24:19 when the aircraft was at 101 kts and approximately 41 feet above ground level, the first officer asked the captain to raise the flaps. While the aircraft was losing altitude, the maximum speed of 105 kts was recorded and aircraft was passing through 10 feet above ground level. Also, at this time the first officer asked the captain to reduce left engine power. The first officer judged that there was no option other than to make the aircraft land on the remaining runway. The aircraft hit the runway surface with landing gear retracted, approximately 9000 ft from the beginning of runway 25L. The aircraft continued to drag on the runway while continuously drifting right for 800 ft before departing towards right side on the fair weather strip.
After travelling approximately 600 ft on the fair weather strip, the aircraft veered towards the left and came to a final stop on the runway 1050 ft short from end of runway.
As the captain was seriously injured, the first officer brought fuel control levers, propeller levers and power levers back; put the battery and generators off after the aircraft came to halt. An immediate evacuation of the passengers was carried out.";08:20;Beechcraft 1900D;Aircraft Sales & Services Limited (ASSL);Friday 18 March 2016

The aircraft departed San Antonio for flight test number 231 for flight flutter certification. The first flutter mission, flight test number 230, was flown one day earlier with the same pilot onboard. The pilot terminated the flight after an uncommanded roll to the left, and a subsequent discrepancy was noticed between his displayed airspeeds and those reported by a chase plane pilot. After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 39,000 feet and set up for a shallow dive along a 090-degree track. This time no problems were noted. The airplane subsequently turned back to the west and began to climb back to 39,000 feet to set up for another dive to the flight test point along a 270-degree magnetic track. This run also was uneventful. The pilot was then cleared to the next test point. However, the pilot did not acknowledge the clearance, but instead, reported that the airplane was rolling to the right, and he couldn't stop it. About 30,000 feet, the test airplane began rolling to the right. The rolling maneuver appeared to be stable, and continued unchanged until ground impact. The airplane rolled about 7 times during a 49-second timeframe, from about 30,500 feet until a near-vertical ground impact.
Although the manufacturer’s engineering analysis (which did not include any high-speed wind tunnel testing) had predicted positive lateral stability up to Mach 0.90, lateral control was lost during the accident flight below that speed. After the accident, the company conducted high-speed wind tunnel tests, and found that lateral stability decreased with increasing Mach and angle of attack (AOA). Lateral stability became negative (unstable) above Mach 0.83, and rudder input intended to augment lateral trim above a certain Mach could aggravate the situation.";10:05;Sino Swearingen SJ30-2;Sino Swearingen;Saturday 26 April 2003

At 12:03 hours local time the aircraft departed Tallinn as crew training flight MYX9001. Onboard were a captain-instructor as well as a second pilot, four students and a Civil Aviation Administration inspector. 
Numerous circuits and touch-and-goes were performed, including two full stop landings. 
During final approach to runway 08 at 17:04, the aircraft stopped responding to flight control inputs. Altitude was lost and the aircraft hit the runway. The engines touched the runway and the 
main landing gear doors broke. 
The aircraft then managed to gain altitude and the pilots were able to stabilize the aircraft and turn back. Both engines, however, lost power after the turn back to the airport.
An emergency landing was carried out at 17:11, about 150 meters from the runway. The aircraft came to a halt in the snow 15 meters south of the runway.
The flight crew members evacuated the aircraft via the L1 door emergency escape slides.

Fresno Yosemite International Airport (FAT), Fresno, California. The airplane was registered to Minden Air Corporation and operated as Tanker 48 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forestry Service.
The captain reported that following an uneventful aerial drop, the flight was returning to Porterville. During the descent check, he noticed that the hydraulic pressure indicated 0 and that the first officer subsequently verified that the sight gauge for the main hydraulic fluid reservoir was empty. The first officer opened the jet engine doors successfully as the captain selected gear down with no response. The captain notified base personnel at Porterville of the situation, and informed them that they would be orbiting to the east of the airport to troubleshoot. The captain and first officer performed the emergency checklist, and verified that the nose wheel landing gear was extended. The captain stated that the first officer then installed the pin in the nose wheel landing gear as part of the emergency checklist.
The flight diverted to Fresno due to a longer runway and emergency resources as both pilots briefed the no-flap landing procedure, airspeeds, and approach profile. As the flight continued toward Fresno, the flight crew informed Fresno Approach Control of the hydraulic system failure, and continued to perform the emergency gear extension checklist. The first officer extended the main landing gear using the emergency gear release, which resulted in three down and locked landing gear indications in the cockpit. As the flight neared Fresno, the first officer added 2 gallons of hydraulic fluid to the main hydraulic reservoir while the captain attempted to extend the flaps unsuccessfully. Subsequently, the flight landed normally on runway 26R. 
During the landing roll, the nose wheel landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest nose low.
The first officer reported that following completion of the emergency nose gear extension checklist, he physically inserted the nose gear pin in place prior to the landing at Fresno.

The aircraft departed Delhi Airport as flight 9W2793 at 17:40 local time (12:10 UTC).
While en route ATIS was obtained by the crew approximately at 115 NM from Indore and the arrival briefing was completed at 100 NM from Indore. The crew asked ATC for permission to descend at 19:10, much before their descent point, so as to keep clear of weather and avoid turbulence. The winds reported by ATC were 130° and 08 knots. As the winds were favourable for runway 07 the crew decided for a VOR approach to runway 07 via DME arc.
At 19:23 crew reported commencing the arc. While on final approach the crew asked for winds, ATC informed crew that the winds were 320° and 12 knots. The crew also saw tail winds on their Primary Flight Display (PFD) and decided to discontinue the approach. ATC then cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach to runway 25 from overhead. The crew then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 via the DME arc, as there was weather overhead. This was accepted by ATC at 19:31. At the same time ATC also informed crew that winds were then 100° and 12 knots. The aircraft climbed 4000 feet and was kept left of the runway, keeping runway in visual contact.
The crew continued with the approach and went out for 15 NM to avoid weather before turning right to intercept the ILS. The flight reported established on localizer at 19:37 and was informed by ATC of moderate rain on airfield. At 19:38 crew reported intercepting ILS and was cleared to land with reported winds of 13 knots at 160°. As per the statement of crew the approach was clear and runway lights could be seen from 13 NM. The runway lights and PAPI lights appeared bright and hence the crew requested ATC to reduce the intensity of the lights.
As the aircraft descended through 600 feet, auto pilot was disconnected. After the aircraft touched down, it veered to the right. The PIC tried to control the aircraft using rudder to turn it to the left. However aircraft went excessively to the left. The PIC was also warned by the co-pilot about the aircraft heading.

The aircraft was cleared for the VOR B approach to Butte at 14:48. A weather front had been approaching the area from the south to the north/northeast. Weather conditions included icing conditions followed by heavy snow fall with poor visibility and variable winds in the mountains. 
According to the approach plate, the transition to the approach is via a DME arc at 9,000 feet with no procedure turn. The flight is to track inbound on the 127 degree radial, descending down to, but no lower than, 7,700 feet to the initial approach fix (IAF). After crossing the IAF, the flight is to turn to 097 degrees for 10 nautical miles and descend to 6,900 feet. The remainder of the 1.5 nautical miles to the runway is to be flown under visual conditions. 
During the descent the airplane collided with trees and subsequently the mountainous terrain on a heading of approximately 127 degrees and about 6,900 feet mean sea level. The initial impact point was located approximately nine nautical miles on a magnetic bearing of 130 degrees from the IAF. Documentation of the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) on the left side instrument panel indicated that the course arrow was positioned to approximately 127 degrees, the inbound heading to the IAF. The co-pilot (right side) course arrow was positioned to 115 degrees. The location of the wreckage and the 127 degree heading on the HSI indicate that the pilots failed to follow the approach procedure and turn to a heading of 097 degrees after crossing the IAF.

All four other crew members on board were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight which departed Cambridge Airfield.

The airplane had been operating as a communications relay for the London Olympics and was returning to Cambridge. While descending to FL180 the pilots experienced a progressive failure of all of the electrical equipment, with the exception of the left instrument panel Electronic Flight Information System display. This remained powered by a backup power supply. However, as the display was giving erroneous information, the pilots decided to turn it off. The abnormal checklist did not contain a procedure for a total electrical failure, so the Pilot Flying turned off both generators and the battery switch before selecting them on again in an attempt to restore the electrical supply. He also selected the alternate inverter and the PNF recycled the cabin power supply switches. The PF stated that he did not attempt to select the generators to RESET. The left instrument panel had functioning ASI and vertical speed indicator (VSI) instruments; the right panel had a working attitude indicator (which was vacuum-driven), ASI and altimeter indications. The engine rpm gauges and standby compass remained operational. 

Mindful of avoiding a security alert during the Olympic Games, the crew carried out the pre-briefed communications failure procedure and turned the aircraft onto a northerly heading to clear the London TMA, before proceeding towards a designated holding area. As the aircraft approached the Wisbech area, the commander recognised some land features. The aircraft descended to 5,000 ft from where the crew were able to identify additional landmarks and navigate visually towards Cambridge Airport. By this time the aircraft had been flying for some time without electrical power and therefore without operating fuel gauges, and the crew were concerned about the aircraft's remaining endurance.
When they arrived near the airport, they circled it to alert ATC to their presence and then carried out the Landing Gear Manual Extension procedure. When carrying out the procedure the pilots operated the landing gear control handle, but omitted to pull the landing gear relay circuit breaker. The PF operated the alternate extension handle to extend the landing gear. Initially, the handle was easy to operate and the pilots could see the main landing gear as it started to extend. The PF stated that he stopped operating the handle when heavy resistance was felt, in order not to damage the system. The PF also stated that the PNF had mentioned to him not to force the handle. The PF asked the PNF to check the resistance of the handle, which he did. The PF continued to operate the handle whilst they positioned the aircraft downwind and onto base leg, but stopped pumping each time he felt heavy resistance.
The PF carried out a flapless approach and the aircraft touched down gently at approximately 100 kt. Almost immediately after touchdown, the landing gear started to collapse. The PNF immediately operated the fuel condition levers which shut down the engines and feathered the propellers. The aircraft settled onto the centreline luggage pod and the main undercarriage doors. It came to rest after a total ground run of approximately 400 m, during which it yawed slightly to the right. The PF was able to counteract the yaw with rudder sufficiently to prevent the aircraft from leaving the paved surface.
After it had come to a halt, the commander ordered the technicians to evacuate. The pilots then completed the shutdown checklist before also vacating the aircraft. The flight time from the electrical failure until the landing was approximately 37 minutes.";16:40;Beechcraft B200 Super King Air;ASL - Air Service Liege;Saturday 28 July 2012

Both occupants died in the accident.
Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal cross-country flight from Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah, about 09:50, with an intended destination of Tucson International Airport, Arizona.
The pilot contacted the SLC departure controller at 0951:59 and reported that he was climbing through 7,500 ft mean sea level (msl) for 10,000 ft. The controller then cleared the pilot to climb to and maintain Flight Level 230 (FL230), and to delete speed restrictions; the pilot confirmed the clearance. At 0952:21, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 14,000 ft, to delete all speed restrictions, and asked him what speed he was climbing at; the pilot confirmed the clearance and stated that he was climbing at 200 knots (kts).

At 0955:01, while approaching 14,000 ft the pilot reported that he had a failure with his Flight Management System (FMS), that he was ""switching to NAV for a second,"" and would be exceeding the assigned altitude. This was followed by an unintelligible transmission. At 0955:16, the controller instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 14,000 ft and to fly his present heading. About 10 seconds later, the pilot advised the controller that he had an autopilot failure, and requested a climb to visual meteorological conditions. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain FL180. At 0955:47, the pilot responded by confirming the climb to FL180. The controller then asked the pilot if he needed assistance. The pilot did not immediately respond, and the controller asked him a second time. At 0956:16, the pilot responded ""negative,"" saying that he was ""just trying to get to clear skies,"" and was climbing to FL180. The pilot stated that his ""number 2"" was working, and that his ""altitude"" had failed. The pilot concluded the transmission by saying, ""...so, uh, my number two is working, climbing to one eight thousand.""

At 0956:32, the controller advised the pilot that traffic would be crossing above him at FL190, and that it was important that he level the airplane at FL180; the pilot replied, ""We'll be watching."" At 0956:45, the controller advised the pilot of two areas of light precipitation directly ahead of the airplane, and asked the pilot if he would need vectors to clear the weather. At 0956:59, the pilot responded that he would appreciate any vectors possible. Shortly thereafter, at 0957:06, the controller asked the pilot to ""...paint a picture for me of where you think the clearest skies would be. I can vector you wherever you need to go."" At 0957:12, the pilot replied that he was heading to TUS, his altitude would not hold, and that he was hand flying the airplane. About this time, radar showed the airplane beginning a right turn from its previously-established southerly heading to a southwesterly heading, though the airplane had neither been cleared to do so by the controller nor had the pilot informed the controller of the deviation. About 0957:20, the pilot transmitted that he would appreciate any vectors possible. About 15 seconds later, the controller advised the pilot that he was showing him at 17,500 ft, directed the pilot to fly his present heading, and stated that the airplane would be clear of the precipitation in about 4 miles. About 17 seconds later, the pilot transmitted, ""...ok, MAYDAY. I do need to get up higher. I am losing different instruments. I'd really like to get clear of weather."" At 0958:01, the controller issued the pilot a clearance to climb and maintain FL230, which the pilot confirmed. About 0958:26, the controller amended the previous clearance and instructed the pilot to climb to and maintain FL310, which the pilot initially confirmed, but shortly thereafter stated, ""...yeah. I can't even dial that in. Still climbing, passing twenty thousand, so I'm just going to be reading it out to be sure my second is operating correctly.""

At 0958:46, the controller stated that he was showing the airplane climbing through 20,200 ft, and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue to TUS; the pilot replied, ""That is affirmative."" At 0958:53, when the airplane was at 20,700 ft, the controller issued the pilot a no-gyro turn to the left for vectors to the southeast; this occurred about 1 minute 41 seconds after the airplane had turned southwest. Radar data showed that the pilot initiated a right turn from a southwesterly heading at an altitude of 20,700 ft. At 0959:12, the airplane reached an altitude of 21,300 ft. msl, and was still in the right turn. At 0959:13, the controller stated, ""November one bravo x-ray. I show you in a right turn. Can you turn left?"" At 0959:17, while climbing out of 21,300 ft, the pilot replied that he was ""trying to climb.""

About 0959:47, the controller advised the pilot that he had lost the airplane's altitude readout, and asked the pilot the airplane's altitude. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot. Between 0959:49 and 0959:58, the airplane descended from an altitude of 21,300 ft to 16,000 ft, with its rate of descent during this time increasing from 9,600 ft per minute (fpm) to 36,000 fpm.
The airplane's wreckage was located in open, flat pasture ground, about 1 nautical mile southwest of Cedar Fort, Utah, and about 28 nm south-southwest of SLC. A survey of the accident site revealed that the linear debris path of wreckage extended for about 1 nm on a west to east orientation.";10:00;Cessna 525 CitationJet;Donald L.

There were no injuries.
The airplane operated on a ferry flight from Madina (MED), Saudi Arabia carrying ten crew members.
The visibility at Jeddah was good with a few clouds present. During the initial ILS approach to runway 16R, while at 8 nautical miles and 2600 feet, the landing gear handle was lowered. Both main landing gears extended and locked down and, the nose gear doors opened but the nose landing gear did not lower. The captain who was then the Pilot Monitoring (PM) took over the controls and carried out a missed approach.
The First Officer (FO) became the Pilot Monitoring (PM). SVA 2865 was then given an area to the northeast of Jeddah to carry out attempts at lowering the nose gear.
The flight crew attempted to manually free fall the nose landing gear at least ten times. The nose landing gear would not lower into the locked position, but the nose gear doors remained open during all those attempts.
As a precautionary measure, SVA 2865 performed a fly-by of runway 16R at 500 ft. The air traffic controller confirmed that the nose landing gear was not down.
SVA 2865 was vectored over the Red Sea to lower the fuel load, thus reducing the landing weight. During this period, the Fire & Rescue Services (FRS) at Jeddah foamed a portion of runway 16L between taxiway Kilo 5 (K5) and K2. 
SVA 2865 was vectored for an instrument approach for runway 16L. The Auto Pilot and the Auto Throttle Systems were OFF. The surface winds were from 220° at 12 knots (kt), gusting to 19 kt and the temperature was +37 Celsius (°C).
The flight crew used the ""Landing with Nose Landing Gear Abnormal"" checklist ensuring the aircraft was properly prepared and configured for the approach, the before landing, the flare and the touchdown sequences, including when the aircraft stopped and the necessary procedures to secure the aircraft before evacuation.
The aircraft landed on its main landing gear 4000 ft past the threshold of runway 16L. The nose of the aircraft was slowly lowered to the runway with the nose landing gear doors touching the runway within the foamed area 4500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The front of the fuselage then touched the runway within the last portion of foam, 3500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The nose area of the aircraft slid on the runway, where sparks were present until the aircraft came to a full stop 1500 ft prior to the end of runway 16L.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The local systems flight test originated at Bemidji, Minnesota, at 17:40.
Following takeoff and raising the landing gear, the red warning light in the landing gear handle failed to go out. The pilot said that he recycled the landing gear, but could not get the red light to go out. The pilot said that he continued with the test flight. On his return to the airport the pilot said he put the landing gear handle down and nothing happened. He recycled the handle two additional times with no results. The pilot overflew the airport and confirmed with his company's maintenance that the landing gear were still up. The pilot said that he then manually pumped the landing gear down, but only the nose gear and right main gear green indicator lights illuminated. The pilot overflew the airport again. His company's maintenance told him that the three gear were down. The pilot came into land. He said that he touched down on the right main gear first, and then gently lowered the left main gear to the runway. The landing gear held. The pilot said he then tried to apply some reverse thrust. Suddenly, the left main gear collapsed, and the left wing struck the runway.

Nothing more was heard from the flight when ATC tried to clear the flight to land around 07:03. The Boeing slammed into a coconut plantation in Mt. Kalangan, Sitio Camanlangan in Barangay San Isidro, disintegrated and caught fire. The accident site is around 500 feet above sea level; at that point the altitude of the aircraft should have been 1500 feet.

There were 8 crew members and 117 passengers on board. The copilot was Pilot Flying. 
After an uneventful flight of approximately two hours, the aircraft was established on ILS, for landing on runway 30 at Ponta Delgada Airport. Final approach was performed with both autopilots engaged in LAND mode and Auto Throttle engaged with SPEED mode selected. The aircraft was stabilized on glide slope and localizer, with an approach airspeed Vapp of 132 kts, for a Vref of 126 kts. Descending through 286ft (Radio Altimeter) the autopilots were disengaged. The aircraft was thereafter flown manually, assisted by the use of flight directors and autothrottle.
Below 20 feet at a slightly high descent rate there was a short flare followed by a light bounce with spoilers extended. The ensuing aircraft's natural aerodynamic tendency was an increase in the pitch attitude in conjunction with a pulling force exerted on the control column with a high pitch rate (3°/s) and increasing high pitch up attitude (up to 14.82°). This manoeuvre, most likely to avoid a hard nose wheel ground contact, made the tail strike the ground. By the time the main landing gear shock absorbers were fully compressed the aircraft’s pitch angle had exceeded the ground/ tail clearance of 13.2°.
The aircraft was taxied to the apron and a maintenance preliminary check was performed. The aircraft had sustained serious damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, where the lower skin panels were abraded by contact with the runway surface. In some areas, the skin was buckled through its full thickness and some vertical struts bent the attachment area in the airframe structure.";20:10;Airbus A310-304;SATA Internacional;Saturday 2 March 2013

The airplane was destroyed and the 55 passengers and 7 crew fatally injured.
Flight 981 departed Dubai at 18:37 hours UTC on March 18.
A preliminary flight data analysis revealed that the crew was performing a manual approach to runway 22 with the autopilot disconnected . Weather conditions were poor with a cloud base at 630 meters, wind 230 degrees at 13 meters per second, maximum 18 meters per second, light rain shower, mist, severe turbulence and moderate windshear.
At 22:42 UTC (01:42 local time) in the course of the initial approach at a height of 340 meters (1115 feet), the flight received a windshear alert. The flight crew decided to go around and then continued to a holding pattern waiting for improved weather conditions.
The flight left the holding pattern at 00:28 UTC (03:28 LT) and descended towards Rostov for another attempted approach to runway 22. 
As the crew were proceeding with another manual approach, they decided to go around again at a height of 220 meters (721 feet), 4,5 km before the runway. They initiated a climb with a vertical speed of up to 20 m/s and setting the engines to maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust.
One of the probable causes of the go-around decision could have been the 20-knot increase of indicated speed to as much as 176 knots within 3 seconds, which might have been an indication of a windshear.
In the course of the go-around the crew set flaps to 15° and retracted the landing gear.
At the height of 1900 ft (approx. 600 m) after reaching the pitch angle of 18° the pilot flying pushed on the control column, which led to a decrease in vertical acceleration of up to 0.5, increase in forward speed and, consequently, automatic retraction of flaps from 15° to 10° at a speed of over 200 knots.
The short-term decrease in engine thrust within 3 seconds resulted in decreasing speed and flaps extension to 15°, although the following crew inputs to regain maximum takeoff/go-around thrust led to speed increase and reiterated automatic flaps retraction to 10°. The flaps remained in the latter configuration until the impact.
The pilot flying, by pulling up the control column, continued climbing with a vertical speed of as much as 16 m/s.
At a height of 900 m there was a simultaneous control column nose down input and stabilizer nose down deflection from -2,5 deg (6,5 units) to +2,5 deg (1,5 units). The FDR recorded a nose down stabilizer input from the stabilizer trim switch of the control wheel lasting 12 seconds, while the CVR record contains a specific noise of rotation of the trim wheels located on both sides of the central pedestal. As a result the aircraft, having climbed to about 1000 m, turned into descent with a negative vertical acceleration of -1g. The following crew recovery actions did not allow to avoid an impact with the ground.
The aircraft hit the runway about 120 m from the threshold with a speed of over 600 km/h and over 50 degrees nose down pitch.

He emerged armed with a .22 caliber handgun and what was later determined to be a fake hand grenade. While on his way to the cockpit, the passenger encountered a flight attendant, pulled out the handgun, and said that he was hijacking the plane. He subsequently fired a single shot toward the cockpit door, although it is believed this was done accidentally. The hijacker then ordered the flight attendant to ask the pilot to open the door.
Once inside the cockpit, the man threatened to blow up the aircraft if his demands were not met. The hijacker insisted that the plane return to Davao but was told that there was not enough fuel. The man then collected money from the passengers and crew and demanded that the rear door be opened so that he could jump out using a homemade parachute. After the cabin was depressurized, a flight attendant opened the left rear door and the hijacker jumped out. The crew continued the flight on to Manila, where the plane landed safely. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew members.

All 108 passengers and six crew members were killed in the accident.
The airplane was operated by Kenya Airways as flight KQ507 from Abidjan Airport (ABJ), Ivory Coast to Nairobi (NBO), Kenya via Douala (DLA), Cameroon. The flight from Abidjan to Douala was reportedly conducted without incident. 
The flight arrived about 22:00 hours local time, May 4. The scheduled departure time of 23:00 was delayed due to weather which consisted of thunderstorms with heavy rain showers. When the weather improved, flight 507 taxied to runway 12. The aircraft took off and climbed into the dark night. There were no external visual references, yet no instrument scanning was done by the crew. At 1000 feet climbing, the pilot flying released the flight controls for 55 seconds without having engaged the autopilot. The bank angle of the airplane increased continuously by itself very slowly up to 34 degrees right and the captain appeared unaware of the airplane’s changing attitude.
Just before the ""Bank Angle"" warning sounds, the captain grabbed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane, and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the bank angle to 50 degrees right.
At about 50 degrees bank angle, the autopilot was engaged and the inclination tended to stabilize; then movements of the flight controls by the pilot resumed and the bank angle increased towards 70 degrees right. A prolonged right rudder input brought the bank angle to beyond 90 degrees. The airplane descended in a spiral dive and crashed into a mangrove swamp.";00:08;Boeing 737-8AL;Kenya Airways;Saturday 5 May 2007

All 147 passengers and six crew members were killed. There were 6 ground fatalities.
The airplane was on the fourth flight segment of the day, consisting of two round-trips between Lagos and Abuja. The accident occurred during the return leg of the second trip. The first officer was Pilot Flying.
Flight DAN992 initiated engine startup at 14:36, taxied to runway 04 at Abuja Airport and was later airborne at 14:58. Fuel endurance was 3.5 hours. The flight climbed to a cruise altitude of 26,000 ft.
DAN992 made contact with Lagos Area Control Center at 15:18. At the time the captain and first officer were in a discussion of a nonnormal condition regarding the correlation between the engine throttle setting and an engine power indication. However, they did not voice concerns then that the condition would affect the continuation of the flight. The flight crew continued to monitor the condition and became increasingly concerned as the flight transition through the initial descent from cruise altitude at 15:22 and the subsequent approach phase.
DAN992 reported passing through 18,100 at 15:30. Shortly afterwards the crew confirmed that there was no throttle response on the left engine and subsequently the Captain took over control as Pilot Flying (PF). The flight was however continued towards Lagos with no declaration of any distress message. With the confirmation of throttle response on the right engine, the engine anti-ice, ignition and bleed-air were all switched off. At 15:32, the crew observed the loss of thrust in engine no. 1.
Between 15:37 and 15:41 the flight crew were engaged in pre-landing tasks including deployment of the slats, and extension of the flaps and landing gear. At 15:41:16 the first officer inquired, ""both engines coming up?"" and the captain replied ""negative."" The flight crew subsequently discussed and agreed to declare an emergency. At 15:42:10, DANA 992 radioed an emergency distress call indicating ""dual engine failure...negative response from throttle.""
At 15:42:35, the flight crew lowered the flaps further and continued with the approach and discussed landing alternatively on runway 18L. At 15:42:45, the captain reported the runway in sight and instructed the first officer to raise the flaps and 4 seconds later to raise the landing gear.
At 15:43:27 hours, the captain informed the first officer ""we just lost everything, we lost an engine. I lost both engines"". During the next 25 seconds the flight crew was attempting to restart the engines. 
The airplane did not reach the runway and crashed in a residential area about 9,3 km short of the runway 18R.
During the impact sequence, the airplane struck an incomplete building, two trees and three buildings. The wreckage was confined, with the separated tail section and engines located at the beginning of the debris field. A fire erupted.

An investigation by AIB Nigeria showed that the captain was employed by Dana Air on 14th March, 2012. He was originally from the United States, but was suspended in 2009 by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for some misdemeanours.
It was noted that most of the recommendation letters submitted by the captain were also signed. Further, the line trainings that preceded the captain's checkout had a lot of adverse remarks made by the training captain.
He started flying as checked out captain on 2nd May, 2012 and had accrued over 120 hours of flight time before the accident.
Tear down of the engines showed that the no.1 engine was overhauled in the U.S in August 2011 and was not in compliance with Service Bulletin SB 6452. Both engines had primary and secondary fuel manifold assemblies fractured, cracked, bent, twisted or pinched which led to fuel leaks, fuel discharge to bypass duct, loss of engine thrust and obvious failure of engine responding to
throttle movement.
This condition was similar to the no.1 engine of a different Dana Air MD-80, 5N-SAI, that was involved in an incident in October 2013 when the aircraft returned to the departure airport with the engine not responding th throttle movements. This engine also was not in compliance with Service Bulletin SB 6452. This bulletin was issued in 2003 and called for the installation of new secondary fuel manifold assemblies, incorporating tubes fabricated from new material which has a fatigue life that was approximately 2 times greater than the previous tube material.";15:45;McDonnell Douglas DC-9-83 (MD-83);Dana Air;Sunday 3 June 2012

There were 157 passengers and 13 crew members on board. Some 46 passengers were injured. 
Taban Air flight 6437 originated in Abadan Airport (ABD) and diverted to Isfahan (IFN) because of poor weather at Mashhad Airport (MHD). When weather conditions had improved, the flight left Isfahan at 05:35. En route the visibility deteriorated again, forcing the crew to enter a holding pattern.
While waiting for the fog to clear, one of the passengers became seriously ill. Despite the limited visibility, the captain declared a medical emergency and attempted to land at Mashhad. During the landing the tail struck the ground. The right wing also struck the ground as the airplane veered off the runway. The undercarriage collapsed and a fire erupted.

When they arrived in the vicinity of gate 10, the mechanic who was steering the plane, activated the parking brake and waited for ground personnel and a jetway operator to arrive. After the ground personnel arrived he released the parking brake. The airplane did not move and he advanced the throttles out of their idle detents ""a couple of inches, about halfway."" The airplane began to move at a ""fairly decent speed,"" and he realized the throttles were still out of the idle detent position. He pulled the throttle back and applied brakes; however, the airplane did not slow and continued until it struck the concrete support column of the jetway, and the left wing contacted the right side of the Boeing 757, parked at gate 9. The nose gear sheared off the Airbus, and the right side of the Boeing sustained a 6-foot long, 2-foot wide gash, just aft of the R1 door.
The mechanic estimated that the airplane was about halfway down the parking line when he pulled back the throttles. Initial review of the flight data recorder for the time period surrounding the accident revealed that about 10 seconds after the parking brake was released, the thrust lever angles for both engines were increased to about 17 degrees for about 8 seconds, before they were returned to the idle position.

The captain, who was an instructor, sat in the right seat and the trainee in the left seat for training to obtain the type rating for First Officer certification in the Japan Coast Guard. 
The final part of the training was a  flap up landing at Sendai Airport, Japan. The captain and the trainee completed the flap up landing checklist just before the arrival at Yuriage (a visual reporting point of Sendai Airport) and the captain told the trainee that if the pitch angle (nose-up angle) exceeded 6°, corrective control would have to be performed by pushing the control column forward. Vref (reference speed for landing) was 126 kt. The aircraft entered the traffic pattern of runway 09 and landed around 15:58.
Although the trainee made the main landing gear touch down near the aiming point marking for the runway 09, he felt it took a great deal of time to lower the nose. This time the captain on the right seat pushed the control column forward since he feared a tail strike. Then the nose landing gear touched the ground with stronger impact than usual (+1.47 g). In. Both the captain and the trainee were not aware of irregularity of the aircraft in landing roll, therefore they continued taxi and the aircraft arrived at the apron at around 16:05.

Flight AI890 was a domestic service from Imphal to Guwahati and Delhi in India.
The aircraft landed at Guwahati at 11:15 UTC and departed for Delhi at 12:05 UTC with 12.7 tonnes of fuel on board. The filed alternates for the sector were Lucknow and Jaipur in that order. 
Overhead Lucknow, the crew received the Lucknow weather and when the aircraft was in range the Delhi ATIS weather was also copied.
While in contact with Delhi ATC, the flight was advised to join the hold as the runway 28 RVR at Delhi had dropped to the lower end of CAT I operations. At this point runway 29 was below minima. AI890 was number twelve in sequence and continued to remain in the holding pattern for the next 20-25 minutes. During this period there was no attempt on the part of flight crew to seek Lucknow weather. Air India Flight dispatch also did not given any advice to the flight about Jaipur or Lucknow weather. The weather (visibility / RVR) reported on runway 29 was below CAT I conditions so runway was not available for this flight at that moment as the First Officer was only Cat I qualified. The aircraft flew 3 holds before intercepting the localizer runway 28 at 35 miles. RVR runway 28 also dropped below Cat. I minimas, therefore the crew discontinued approach and climbed to 8000 feet on runway heading before going on heading 180.
Though the first planned diversion alternate was Lucknow, which had visibility of 2000 m (above minima), the captain elected to divert to Jaipur. Reason was that they were closer to Jaipur and they had inquired about the visibility from Dispatch for Jaipur, which was provided as 2000 m. At this stage the crew did not check complete weather of Jaipur. Minimum diversion fuel to Jaipur was 2.9 tonnes. AI890 commenced diversion to Jaipur with Fuel on Board of 3.1 tonnes. 
The aircraft came in contact with Jaipur for the first time when it was at 68 DME from Jaipur. At that time the crew came to know of the complete weather of Jaipur from the ATIS, which read: visibility of 900 m, dew point 13°C, temperature 13°C, and RVR 1000m. At 60 miles and passing flight level 138, the crew informed Jaipur that the aircraft was descending for flight level 100 as cleared by Delhi control. The aircraft again informed Jaipur ATC its position at 55 miles, 50 miles and 42 miles from Jaipur which were also acknowledged by Jaipur ATC. During these contacts, weather of Jaipur was neither asked by the crew nor provided by ATC. When the aircraft was at flight level 83, the crew asked ATC Jaipur to confirm that they could carry out an ILS approach for runway 27 via the 10 DME arc. While confirming the requested approach, Jaipur ATC informed all the stations about the weather at that moment as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m. When the aircraft was at 30 miles from Jaipur, Jaipur ATC passed weather as visibility 400 m, RVR 1000 m and trend visibility becoming 350 m. At 28 DME from Jaipur, the aircraft was maintaining 6000 feet and on request was cleared by Jaipur ATC to descend to 5000 feet.
When the aircraft was at 25 DME, from Jaipur, ATC advised that the weather was deteriorating rapidly and visibility was 400 meters. The crew however informed ATC that they were committed to land at Jaipur due to the aircraft fuel state. The fuel on board at that point of time was approx 2.6 tonnes and approach was commenced for Jaipur with a visibility of 500 m with trend reducing.
The aircraft was no. 2 in approach at Jaipur and was cleared for the VOR/DME arc ILS approach runway 27 at 25 nm. 
Due to reducing visibility, Jaipur ATC asked all the aircraft inbound for Jaipur to come over head and join the JJP hold. The crew of AI890 asked for the weather which was provided as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m though RVR deteriorating to 550 m. The flight continued and flew the VOR/DME arc for an ILS runway 27 approach. ATC transmitted the RVR as 200 m and visibility as 50 m with trend reducing. Another scheduled flight ahead of AI890 carried out a missed approach and diverted to Ahmedabad. When the aircraft was above MDA (1480 feet AGL), ATC reported RVR 50 m and cleared the aircraft to land subject to minima. Both the flight crew maintained that they had seen the runway lights. The ILS approach was performed with dual auto pilot until 200ft Radio Altitude. After descending below MDA on auto pilot, the commander disconnected the auto pilot. The captain performed the final approach manually. The aircraft deviated to the left of the runway centre line and touched down on soft ground (in kutcha) on the left hand side of the runway. During touchdown and landing roll, the visibility was zero and crew were unable to see any of the reference cues. The crew had heard rumbling sound during landing roll. The commander stated that he did the manual landing as he was not sure if he could do an auto-land on a ground facility which is CAT I certified airfield in actual zero visibility.
The aircraft continued to roll/ skid on the unpaved surface and during this period the left wing impacted trees causing damage to the left wing. Thereafter aircraft turned right and entered the runway finally coming to a halt on the left hand side of runway. There was no fire.
The aircraft was disabled on the runway, forcing the following flight (a SpiceJet Boeing 737-800, flight SG256) to carry out a missed approach. That flight was already low on fuel after diverting from Delhi to Jaipur, just like AI890.
The captain of SG256 then decided to return to Delhi irrespective of reported visibility and RVR. After diverting to Delhi, the aircraft came in contact with ATC Delhi, declared a MAYDAY due fuel with a request for straight and short vector for ILS 28. During the ILS approach for runway 28, the tower had reported RVR for runway 28 as 375m/900m/50m. A dual channel auto land was carried out.  Fuel remaining at that time was 400 kgs. Fuel remaining during engine shut down was 150 kgs.";21:10;Airbus A320-231;Air India;Sunday 5 January 2014

About 30 minutes into the flight, when the aircraft had climbed to 30,000 feet, the flight crew noticed that the oil quantity parameter in the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) showed 17 units for the left engine but only 1 unit for the right engine.
The flight crew also noticed from the EICAS display that the right engine oil pressure was fluctuating between 65 and 70 psi while the oil temperature for the right engine was 10°C higher than the left engine. However, both the oil pressure and temperature parameters were within the normal operating range.
The flight crew looked through their available manuals but was unable to find an appropriate procedure that addressed the low engine oil quantity situation.
At 03:04 hours, the Pilot-in-command (PIC) contacted their company's engineering control centre for assistance. The engineer informed the PIC that since the oil pressure was within the normal operating range, there could be a faulty oil quantity indication. The engineer advised the PIC to continue with the flight but monitor the right engine oil parameters. The engineer told the PIC that he would also contact the company's technical services personnel for advice.
After being briefed by the engineer on the situation, the technical services personnel believed that it was a faulty oil quantity indication. As the aircraft had just departed and was not far from Singapore, the technical services personnel recommended that the aircraft return to Singapore.
According to the flight crew, as they were passing waypoint VPG at approximately 03:20 hrs, the First Officer performed a routine fuel quantity check. After comparing the TOTALIZER fuel quantity with the planned fuel remaining quantity, it was determined that the fuel consumption was better than expected as the fuel on board was 600 kg more than the expected value.
At 03:28 hrs, the engineer sent a message via the Aircraft Communication and Reporting System (ACARS) to the flight crew informing them about the recommendation by the technical services personnel for the aircraft to return to Singapore and requesting them to contact the engineering control centre.
The PIC contacted the engineering control centre and a conference call among the PIC, the engineering control centre and the technical services personnel was held, which lasted for about 20 minutes. The PIC informed the rest that the flight crew had been monitoring the right engine oil parameters for 50 minutes and other than the indicated low oil quantity, the parameters appeared normal. It was jointly assessed that the flight could continue to Milan with the proviso that the flight crew monitor the right engine oil parameters and contact the engineering control centre for assistance if needed.
Shortly after the conference call ended, the flight crew felt an unusual vibration in the control column and cockpit floor. The flight crew tried to diagnose the problem by changing the engine power settings and found that the vibration disappeared when the power of the right engine was reduced. At about the same time, the flight crew caught a momentary wisp of burnt smell in the cockpit but the smell disappeared quickly.
At 04:04 hrs, the PIC informed the engineering control centre about the vibrations which the flight crew experienced whenever the right engine was operated at higher power settings. In the ensuing conference call among the PIC, the engineering control centre and the technical services personnel, it was assessed that there was no need to shut down the right engine and decided that the aircraft would return to Singapore with the right engine operating at idle power. In the midst of the conference call, the In-flight supervisor (IFS) informed the flight crew that there was a burnt smell detected in the cabin. In response, the flight crew turned off the right engine bleed system.
According to the cabin crew, the smell was particularly strong in the forward part of the aircraft. The cabin crew distributed wet towels for the passengers to hold over their nose and breathe through it. 
After the conference call ended, the flight crew reduced the right engine to idle power and proceeded to turn the aircraft around to return to Singapore. For the return journey to Singapore, the flight crew adopted the procedure for single engine operation, including a descent to 17,000 feet before reducing the right engine to idle power.
When the IFS informed the flight crew that the burnt smell in the cabin was still present, the right air conditioning pack and recirculating fans were switched off. Shortly after, the smell in the cabin subsided.
At 05:21 hrs, the flight crew received a FUEL DISAGREE message on the EICAS. The flight crew performed the FUEL DISAGREE checklist. The FUEL DISAGREE checklist suggested four scenarios in which a fuel leak should be suspected and when the flight crew should perform the FUEL LEAK checklist. One such scenario is when the TOTALIZER fuel quantity is less than the CALCULATED5
 fuel quantity.
The flight crew observed from the display of the flight management system that TOTALIZER fuel quantity was about 79 tonnes and the CALCULATED fuel quantity was about 83 tonnes.
However, the flight crew did not perform the FUEL LEAK checklist. According to the flight crew, they believed the CALCULATED fuel quantity was no longer accurate because input changes had been made to the flight management system after the right engine was set to idle power and they were no longer on the planned flight route.
Thus, the flight crew performed their own fuel calculation by subtracting the amount of fuel consumed from the total amount of fuel at the start of the flight. The fuel consumed was calculated to be about 79 tonnes. As this tallied well with the TOTALIZER fuel quantity figure, the flight crew concluded that the FUEL DISAGREE message was a spurious one and that there was no need to proceed with the FUEL LEAK checklist. 
Several times on the return journey and as the aircraft approached Singapore, the flight crew was queried by the Air Traffic Control (ATC) if they needed any assistance. The flight crew replied that, other than the need to fly at the lower altitude of 17,000 feet, no assistance was needed as all other operations were normal.
Prior to landing, the flight crew jettisoned about 41,500 kg of fuel to bring the aircraft to below its maximum landing weight.
At 06:49 hrs, the aircraft landed on runway 20C. About 20 seconds after the thrust reversers on both engines were deployed, the occupants in the cabin heard two loud bangs, accompanied by two flashes, originating from the right engine area. At the same time, the flight crew heard a soft thud. The Airport Rescue and Firefighting Service (ARFF) personnel who were monitoring the aircraft's arrival informed the Control Tower on seeing the fire at the right engine. The Control Tower informed the flight crew of the fire and instructed the aircraft to stop at the intersection between the runway and rapid exit taxiway E7. The flight crew did not receive any fire warning in the cockpit.
The first foam tender arrived on scene after 57 seconds and started discharging foam at the right engine. The fire was eventually brought under control after about two minutes. Disembarkation commenced at 07:10 hrs via a mobile stairs positioned at the front left door of the aircraft. All occupants, including the flight crew, vacated the aircraft by 07:31 hrs.";06:49;Boeing 777-312ER;Singapore Airlines;Monday 27 June 2016

Some seven minutes after takeoff, the pilot radioed that they were 10 NM from the Gran Roque VOR, at an altitude of 5000 feet. The controller instructed the flight to contact Maiquetia Approach, but no contact was established.
Radar data showed that the flight continued to climb, reaching 5400 feet at a distance of 13.3 NM from the Gran Roque VOR. Speed was 120 knots. At that point the airplane rapidly started to lose altitude and speed.

The 2 pilots were not injured. The flight originated at Opa Locka, Florida (OPF), about 09:52.
The two flight crewmembers reported that, after landing on runway 36, the pilot, who was the pilot flying, applied the brakes normally; however, the airplane did not decelerate as expected. The pilot applied the brakes a second time, and the right main landing gear tire subsequently failed. The airplane departed the end of runway 36 and came to rest in an area of unfinished gravel, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe. 
Examination of the 4,954-feet-long runway revealed that the airplane touched down about 1,400 feet from the approach end. Skid marks were visible for about 2,982 feet, and the tire failure occurred about 3,153 feet into the landing. Examinations revealed that the right main landing gear tire had a flat spot with a 4-inch diameter hole consistent with a locked brake. The airplane was equipped with an optional antiskid wheel braking system; however, it was disabled in 2004.
The pilots reported that they decided to land on runway 36 based on the wind at flight level 180 and that they did not check the surface wind at the airport. The surface wind at the airport at the time of the accident was from 158 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots. Thus, the airplane landed with a significant quartering tailwind, which resulted in it touching down at a location and speed at which the pilots were unable to stop the airplane on the runway using normal braking.";10:37;Cessna 500 Citation I;JJ Aeronautics;Sunday 16 March 2014

The aircraft departed Edinburgh, Scotland, on a scheduled passenger service to Amsterdam at 14:21 UTC. About 15:22 UTC the aircraft entered a holding pattern over the North Sea off the western coast of the Netherlands because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind. 
It left the holding about 15:38 UTC and positioned for an ILS approach to runway 22. During the approach to Schiphol, at approximately 16:30 hours, ATC requested the crew to hold over reporting point SUGOL at flight level (FL) 110 for 20
minutes because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind. ATIS information “Kilo” reported winds from direction 240º with a
velocity of 35 knots, gusting to 40 knots. METAR information reported winds at 37 knots
gusting to 46 at 15.55 (UTC, 16.55 local time).
From SUGOL the crew initially received radar vectors inbound Schiphol. They then were
cleared to intercept the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 22. The ILS for the
approach to runway 22 was intercepted at 18 NM. 
During the descent, at 15:49 UTC, the autopilot disengaged because of gusting winds in the approach and was reengaged by the crew shortly after.
The arrival was flown in speed control mode with an airspeed of 170 knots. Final speed was selected at 130 knots, i.e. normal landing threshold speed (VREF) plus 10 knots to compensate for the gusting winds. At around 15:51 UTC, approximately 5.5 NM from the runway touchdown point, the landing gear was selected down, giving three greens indication in the cockpit shortly after. The crew confirmed the indication, 15 degrees flaps were selected and de-icing systems were selected.
The crew then changed radio frequency to Schiphol Tower and received a clearance for landing on runway 22. The air traffic controller reported the wind from direction 240 degrees with speeds of 36 knots gusting to 48 knots. The crew finished the before landing checklist. They then selected 5 degrees flaps and selected gear down. They confirmed ‘ice protection on’, ‘landing gear three greens’, selected 15 degrees flaps and checked ‘bleed air on’.
At an altitude of 300 feet the flight crew disengaged the autopilot for landing. On short final the crew noticed the PAPI showing they were on the glide path. Although the pilots were aware they would encounter strong winds during landing, including crosswinds, the wind conditions were not extreme and were not above the aircraft’s limitations. Short final was flown under crosswind conditions, with the nose of the aircraft about 20 degrees right of centre line. Just before touch down the pilot flying aligned the nose of the aircraft with the runway centreline and lowered the right wing to compensate for the crosswind, causing the right-hand main wheel to touch the runway first. The aircraft touched down at 15:54 UTC. The crew considered the landing to be firm, but not hard. Almost immediately after touch down the crew noticed the right wing dropping, and a red warning light appeared on the landing gear panel in the cockpit.
The right-hand propeller, right-hand engine nacelle, lower fuselage, wing tip and aileron collided with the runway and the aircraft continued for several hundred meters before coming to a complete stop. This resulted in damage to the right hand propeller, the lower fuselage structure and right-hand outboard wing tip. The right-hand fuselage was also damaged due to fragments from the right-hand propeller and stone strikes. The left-hand main landing gear and nose gear remained extended.
The crew transmitted a MAYDAY call and after coming to a complete stop the cabin attendants started evacuating the passengers via the two aft doors. The crew then shut down the aircraft in accordance with the checklist. As a precaution, they also pulled the circuit breakers from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. During the accident and following evacuation no-one was injured.";16:54;de Havilland Canada DHC-8-402Q Dash 8;Flybe;Thursday 23 February 2017

Of the eight people on board, the pilot and four passengers sustained serious injuries, and three passengers sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the Anaktuvuk Pass Airport at the time of the accident. The flight departed from the Fairbanks Airport, about 10:30, destined for Anaktuvuk Pass. 
The pilot stated that he was flying along the John's River about 2,500 feet msl, 500 feet above ground level (agl) while en route to Anaktuvuk Pass Airport (AKP). About 10 miles from the airport, he began to climb to airport traffic pattern altitude and maintain a flight track on the east side of the river valley to conduct a straight-in approach to runway 2 at AKP. Although some ice was present on the windshield, the deice/anti-ice equipment was operating as designed, and the windshield hot plate remained free of contamination. He stated that due to the overcast skies and snow covered ground, a flat light condition was present.
The aircraft impacted an area of snow-covered tundra, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet msl. The top of the ridge where the airplane impacted is at an approximate elevation of 3,000 feet msl. From the initial point of impact, the airplane traveled about 300 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings. 
Immediately following the accident, a passenger utilized a cellular phone to call for rescue from Anaktuvuk Pass residents. About 20 minutes after the call, the airplane was located and rescue personnel began extricating passengers and transporting them via snow machine to Anaktuvuk Pass for medical attention.";12:05;Cessna 208B Grand Caravan;Wright Air Service;Saturday 2 January 2016

Whilst taxiing to the cleared holding point for takeoff from runway 18, the pilot switched off the landing lights to avoid blinding an approaching aircraft. As a result, he overshot the turning point at taxiway C in the darkness and found himself at the end of taxiway A with insufficient space to turn around. According to him, he decided to maneuvre the aircraft out of the ""dead end"" by turning into the last taxiway, which led to military hangars, and then reversing the aircraft to carry out a 180° turn. This was to be done without external guidance. Whilst reversing the aircraft, the pilot failed to stop it in time, the main wheels rolled off the edge of the taxiway and the aircraft slipped down a steep embankment, coming to rest with the nose-wheel still on the taxiway.";20:50;Boeing 737-2T5;Safair;Monday 10 January 2011

The FDR indicated that while the autopilot was engaged in the descent, the power levers moved from the mechanical autothrottle limit of 44 degrees to the manual limit of 37 degrees. As the aircraft leveled at 16,000 feet the airspeed decreased. The F/O began a right turn to enter a holding pattern and added some power, which stabilized the airspeed at 178 knots. However, the right bank and the resultant angle of attack (AOA) continued to increase, despite left aileron input by the autopilot. As the autopilot reached the maximum input of 20 degrees, bank angle increased past 50 degrees, and the AOA increased rapidly from 7 degrees to 12 degrees. At this point the stick shaker activated, the autopilot independently disconnected, the power was increased, and full left rudder was used to arrest the roll. The bank angle reached 56 degrees, and the AOA reached 13.7 degrees at 177 knots. The aircraft then pitched down, and entered a series of pitch, yaw, and roll maneuvers as the flight controls went through a period of oscillations for about 34 seconds. The maneuvers finally dampened and the crew recovered at approximately 13,000 feet. One passenger was seriously injured and one flight attendant received minor injuries during the upset. 
An analysis showed that the forces during the upset not only had gone above the design limit of the vertical stabilizer, they also apparently had reached the ultimate limit. In June 1997, Airbus requested that American Airlines perform another inspection of the jet to ensure it was not damaged. American inspectors, following Airbus' instructions, examined the tail fin. But they did not use methods that would have allowed them to see inside the tail fin. They saw no damage from their visual inspection, and the jet continued to fly until an ultrasound inspection of the horizontal stabilizer was done in March 2002. The inspection found two crescent-shaped cracks at one of the points where the tail fin attaches to the fuselage. The fin was replaced.";15:29;Airbus A300B4-605R;American Airlines;Monday 12 May 1997

There were 13 people on board; two pilots, a maintenance engineer, and 10 passengers. The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying for the sector to Tanjung Bara, and the copilot was the monitoring pilot.
The flight was normal until 5 minutes before landing when the number 1 (left engine) generator malfunctioned. The pilot in command (PIC) asked the maintenance engineer on board the aircraft, who advised that there was no problem for the aircraft operations.
The aircraft made its final approach to runway 04 at Tanjung Bara at 23:50. The aircraft touched down to the right of the centreline, then diverged right into soft wet ground, impacting a channel embankment and subsequently a barbed-wire airport perimeter fence.
The investigation determined that aircraft was not being flown on a stabilized approach and subsequently touched down to the right of the runway centerline. It then veered to the right of centerline after touchdown and the PICs effort to bring the aircraft back to the runway centreline by using aileron was ineffective.
There was no evidence that visibility affecting visual acquisition of the runway was a factor. However, the investigation considered that a visual approach guidance system such as Visual Approach System Indication (VASI), may have provided additional visual cues to alert the pilots to the prevent the unstabilized approach.";23:50 UTC;CASA/IPTN NC-212 Aviocar 200;Aviastar Mandiri;Thursday 11 January 2007

The flight took place under instrument flight rules. Using radar vectors, EC-HFA was cleared at 12:05 for an ILS approach to runway 14. The right hand seat on the flight deck was occupied by a PPL-rated passenger. During approach, the passenger read out various checklist points, which were each confirmed or commented upon by the pilot.
At 12:06:39, at a distance of approximately 10 NM from ILS DME 14, the aircraft descended below 4000 ft QNH. At 12:07:07 the ATCO informed the pilot that he would be allowed to leave 4000 ft QNH only at a distance of 8 NM from ILS DME 14. The aircraft was already at 3600 ft, so he instructed EC-HFA to climb to 4000 ft QNH in order to be able to reach the ILS glide slope. The pilot answered: ""(...) I got the ILS catched, but I go to 4000 ft."" Subsequent to this radio conversation, the passenger mentioned the following to the pilot, with reference to the approach chart: ""Lo pone aquí. Tenemos las montañas ahí – Here it is. We have hills there."" EC-HFA then climbed back to an altitude of 4000 ft QNH, which it reached at approximately 8 NM. At about 7 NM, it began the descent and therefore found itself above the ILS glide slope. With the message ""All stations, ah... we have now RVR one thousand four hundred metres, that’s ah... showers of snow coming ah... overhead the field and the final, out."" at 12:07:41, the Zurich final ATCO informed all aircraft on the frequency that a snow shower was approaching the airport. A little later, the ATCO asked EC-HFA whether the aircraft was now stabilised on the ILS; the pilot confirmed this. At this time the aircraft was between 7 NM and 8 NM from the threshold of runway 14, approximately 200 ft above the glide slope. The ATCO also informed the pilot that the runway visual range (RVR) was now 1200 m. The pilot thanked him and asked the passenger to continue reading out the checklist.
When the aircraft was approximately six miles from the threshold of runway 14, EC-HFA was asked to contact Zurich aerodrome control. This was confirmed by the pilot on the radio. He repeated the frequency several times to the passenger, who was busy entering the frequencies in this phase of the flight. At 12:09:10, the pilot contacted aerodrome control. There followed a further discussion between the two persons in the cockpit during which the passenger mentioned that it was now essential to fly precisely straight, because there was a 2500 m high tower to one side. It is highly probable that the passenger was referring to an obstacle which is shown on the approach chart with a tower symbol. This obstacle is approximately 9 NM from ILS DME 14, just to the east of the approach centreline and shows an altitude of 2566 ft AMSL. The passenger further suggested that for this reason the autopilot should be used. He finally quoted the value of 2200 ft and asked the pilot whether he did not want to set the flaps to ""full flaps"" position. At this time, EC-HFA received landing clearance for runway 14. This was immediately acknowledged by the pilot. The pilot then confirmed with the words: ""Full flaps... landing gear"" that everything was now ready for the landing. According to the radar recordings, throughout the final approach phase EC-HFA was always between 200 and 300 ft above the glide slope. At approximately 12:11:15, EC-HFA reached the decision height of 1602 ft. The passenger asked the pilot not to fly manually but to continue to let the autopilot fly EC-HFA, because there was no ground contact at this time. Shortly afterwards, the passenger mentioned that he could now see some of the ground. A few seconds later, the passenger said: ""Arrivando...Pista, ahí!...La vés?...Muy bien, vamos muy bien. Dejalo, dejalo que baje - We’re arriving... The runway, there!... Do you see it?... Very good, we’re very good. Let her go, let her go, she has to descend.""

Two crew members and one passenger sustained serious injuries.
The airplane departed Pokhara Airport (PKR) at 08:10 on a domestic flight to Jomsom. While descending towards the destination airport, the Jomsom controller reported that there was a south-westerly 8-12 knot wind with runway 24 in use.
During the approach the pilot in command took over the communication function of the copilot and contacted Jomsom Tower, requesting to use runway 06 instead of runway 24, despite the advice of the tower controller to use runway 24 to avoid tail wind effect in runway 06. 
The tailwind component, exceeded the five knot tailwind limit stipulated in the company’s standard operating procedure.
The airplane touched down 776 feet past the threshold of the 2,424-foot-long runway 06. It covered a distance of 194 feet on the airstrip and veered towards the grassland. 
During the landing roll, when the aircraft was decelerating, the co-pilot had raised the flaps as per the existing practice of carrying out the after the landing checks.""
The pilot in command added power to re-enter the runway. After running 705 feet on the grassland the airplane entered the runway again. Without making his intentions clear to the copilot, the pilot in command continued adding power for go around. 
The accelerating aircraft gained insufficient speed and lift to take off and ran out of the runway 24 end, continued towards the river, hit the barbed fence and gabion wall with an initial impact and finally fell down onto the banks of Kaligandaki River.";08:33;de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300;Nepal Airlines;Thursday 16 May 2013

All six crew members were killed.
The flight departed Jayapura (DJJ) on an scheduled cargo/passenger flight to Wamena (WMX). The airplane carried staples such as rice and flour. The crew consisted of a captain, co-pilot, engineer, loadmaster and two flight attendants. 
The aircraft was being operated under the instrument flight rules (IFR) for the sector from Sentani, and a visual descent, approach and landing at Wamena, because there was no published instrument approach procedure at Wamena.
There was low cloud with a base of 300 meters on the final approach track to runway 15 at Wamena.
The aircraft tracked parallel to, and to the right of the extended runway 15 centreline. During that approach, and while descending through 6,234 feet (790 feet by radio altimeter), the EGPWS voice aural alert 'TERRAIN TERRAIN' sounded.
When the aircraft was passing 6,200 feet (991 feet by radio altimeter) on descent, the EGPWS voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounded. The aircraft started turning left toward runway as it was passing 5,719 feet (540 feet radio altimeter) on descent. As the aircraft passed 5,693 feet (516 feet radio altimeter) on descent, the crew informed the controller that they had the runway in sight. During their attempt to intercept the final approach track, while passing 5,531 feet (320 feet radio altimeter) the captain commented to the copilot ""wah nembak lagi"" [we are overshooting
again].
During the interception towards the runway an EGPWS voice aural alert 'SINK RATE', sounded. This was immediately followed by the voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounding five times. The copilot instructed the captain ""overshoot, overshoot"" after the second of the five 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounds. The FDR showed that the aircraft commenced a go around from a low height above the runway. The controller offered the crew a choice of a landing on runway 33, but the crew elected to make a right circuit for runway 15.
The circuit was flown at a height of between 150 and 350 feet above the aerodrome elevation. During the downwind leg the EGPWS provided the flight crew with eight 'DON'T SINK' and one 'TOO LOW TERRAIN' voice aural alerts. The flight crew did not respond to any of those alerts.
As the aircraft passed abeam the threshold of runway 15, the landing gear was lowered for the second landing approach.
During the right base turn the aircraft was initially flown at a constant 30 degree angle of right bank.
About 100 degrees from runway heading, the copilot said ""OK, sungai ketok"" [OK river in sight]. Four seconds later, when about 85 degrees from runway heading the copilot said ""Pike clear"" [Pike Hill visible].
As the aircraft's heading passed 65 degrees from the runway heading, the copilot called ""be careful pak"" [be careful sir]. A third person in the cockpit commented ""di kiri ada bukit"" [there is a hill on the left].
This was immediately followed, as the aircraft banked through 41 degrees right, by the copilot calling out with increasing concern, ""pak, pak, pak, open pak, kiri, kiri"" [sir, sir, sir, open, sir, left, left].
The engine power was rapidly increased immediately after the copilot called ""open pak"" [open sir]. The copilot commanded ""kiri pak""[left sir] as the captain rolled the aircraft into a left bank and the EGPWS voice aural alert 'DON'T SINK, DON'T SINK' sounded.
As the bank angle exceeded 40 degrees, it entered a 10-degree nosedown pitch attitude. The copilot warned the captain ""don't sink"". The captain immediately responded ""ya, ya"". Three seconds later the copilot said ""left turn"". The EGPWS then sounded the following voice aural alerts in rapid succession: 'TOO LOW - TERRAIN', 'BANK ANGLE - BANK ANGLE', 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN'. At the same time as the EGPWS sounded the 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN' warning, the copilot called with high intonation ""pak, pak, pak"" [sir, sir, sir].
The nose-down pitch attitude reached 6 degrees when the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank. As the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank, landing gear retraction commenced. The EGPWS voice aural alert then sounded TERRAIN, and one second later the copilot called ""pak"" [sir].
At the point of impact with the terrain, the landing gear was half way through the retraction cycle, the left bank was 16 degrees, and the aircraft pitch was 12 degrees nose up. The indicated airspeed at impact was 146 knots.
The aircraft impacted Pikei Hill on Tengah Mountain. 
Wamena Airport is situated at the Baliem Valley with an airport elevation of 5085 feet and surrounded by mountains up to 12.000 feet high. The only navigation aid available is NDB "" ZW"".

Simultaneously, the right engine fire warning activated and other warning lights illuminated. Several circuit breakers tripped. The pilot reported that he was unable to select right engine fuel cut off with the condition lever and could not feather the right propeller with the propeller control. He activated the right fire handle, transmitted a PAN and advised ATC that he was diverting to Young. The pilot was unable to land at Young due to fog but Cootamundra was reported clear. Approaching Cootamundra the pilot transmitted a MAYDAY due to smoke in the cabin and requested emergency services. He positioned the aircraft for an approach to runway 16 and selected the landing gear down but did not get any indication that it was down and locked. He warned the passengers to prepare for a belly landing and lowered full flap. Before touchdown he selected both propeller levers to the feathered position. The aircraft touched down on the extended right main landing gear and skidded along the runway on its nose, left engine nacelle and right main landing gear for approximately 400 m.

The airplane was on approach to Cagliari-Elmas Airport (CAG) following a domestic flight from Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA). 
On the evening of 23 February 2004, the Austrian air taxi operator City-jet was requested to carry out a flight from Cagliari-Elmas Airport (CAG), Sardinia, Italy to Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA) and return. 
The purpose of the flight was to transport a team of three doctors to Rome who would need to remove a organ for transplantation. The crew would wait at the airport to return to Cagliari with the medical staff and the organ. 
CIT Flight 123 took off from Milan Linate at 22:22 and landed at Cagliari without incident at 00:02, February 24. After refueling (1100 liters) and the three passengers had boarded, the aircraft departed at 01:01 bound for Rome, where it landed at 01:51. 
After arriving at Ciampino Airport, the crew filed an IFR flight plan for Cagliari, alternate Olbia, call sign CIT 124, with Estimated Off-Block Time (EOBT) 04:00. The flight was declared STS/HOSP (medical flight). 
After arrival of the medical team, takeoff occurred at 05:00. The aircraft was authorized by Rome ACC to directly enter the airway M126, without carrying out the standard instrument departure. The en route part of the flight to Cagliari was uneventful. 
At 05.37, Rome ACC instructed flight 124 to contact Cagliari APP, After radio contact was established , Cagliari APP provided the weather at the aerodrome: runway in use 32, wind 7 knots from 320°, visibility 12 km scattered clouds at 2000 feet, temperature 10° C, dew point 9° C, QNH 1012.
At 05.41.12, Cagliari APP instructed CIT 124, which at that time was at the waypoint Aledo, to continue the descent over the next waypoint LEDRO up to 5000 feet, to carry out the ILS procedure for a landing on runway 32 and report at Carbonara VOR.
The commander, reading back the instructions, requested permission to conduct a visual approach should he obtain visual contact with the airport: ""Roger, we are cleared now to descend to five thousand feet on the QNH one zero one two and we passing Ledro cleared by ILS three two papa and if we have field visually, we would like to have a visual approach.""
This was confirmed by Cagliari APP. At 05:43 the flight crew radioed: ""CIT 124, we have the field in sight requesting visual approach.""
At that time the aircraft was at FL 96, about 28 nm from Carbonara VOR and about 41 nm from Cagliari VOR. Cagliari APP then asked CIT 124 about the ability to maintain obstacle clearance: ""confirm able to maintain your own separation from the obstacles sir, performing visual approach runway three two"". The pilot just replied: ""affirmative, CIT 124"".
About three minutes later, Cagliari APP informed CIT 124 to continue the descent without descending below 2500 feet and contact Elmas TWR for the further descent: ""[...] CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas Tower 120.6 bye""
The pilot contacted Elmas TWR at 05:47: ""Elmas Tower, buongiorno, CIT 124, visual, left procedure, for visual approach runway 32.""
Elmas TWR responded by reporting the runway in use (32), wind conditions (8 knots from 310°), and told the flight to report on short final for runway 32. This was read back by the crew. 
Two minutes later, while descending over mountainous terrain, flight 124 collided with the side of Su Baccu Malu Mountain (3333 feet).";05:49;Cessna 500 Citation I;City-jet Luftfahrtgesellschaft;Tuesday 24 February 2004

By the time of contacting Khark Island information, weather conditions were reported being CAVOK, wind 300° at 16 knots and flight 4525 has been directed to proceed for a right hand downwind approach to runway 31.
When 10 NM out, the crew requested a wind check. Winds were reported from 300 degrees at 10 knots. Having in mind the tailwind limitation of 15 knots as stated in the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and Operations Manual (OM), the captain judged that a tailwind of 10 knots made it possible to conduct an approach and landing on runway 13. The co-pilot then requested a visual approach to runway 13, which was approved.
The cockpit crew then continued for runway 13, configured the aircraft for landing and completed the landing checklist with an approach speed (target speed) of 129 knots and VREF of 119 knots.
At 300 feet MSL, first officer noticed airspeed had been accelerating to 145 knots and made a standard callout ""airspeed 145 knots"". Instead of performing a go-around, the captain called out ""Auto Brake Out"", and briefed his first officer about the first portion of go-around procedure.

The flight to Kikori was uneventful. The pilot stated that he joined the Kikori circuit upwind for a left downwind and, after completing the pre-landing checks, set up for a landing on runway 30. The pilot reported that, after touchdown, he held the nose wheel off the ground. He stated that the initial landing and roll-through on the steel matting surface were normal. When applying brakes, the aircraft veered left and ran off the runway.  The aircraft subsequently impacted an embankment beyond the left side of the runway, approximately 70 metres from the runway end. The nose of the aircraft was crushed and the nose landing gear partially collapsed rearwards during the impact with the embankment. Two of the left propeller blades were bent.

Based on the differences between the pilot’s statements and the statement by the witness, the AIC was unable to ascertain the exact touchdown point. 

Prior to the accident flight, the aircraft had undergone a 100-hourly maintenance check at Port Moresby performed by the operator’s maintenance provider. The AIC was informed that during this check the brake pads had been changed and the brake system had been bled and refilled with hydraulic fluid. The AIC's on-site investigation of the brake system did not reveal any defects in the system, however, the aircraft had been moved after the accident by the operator's personnel and the AIC was unable to determine to what extent the condition of the aircraft and its systems had changed in the time between the accident and the AIC's arrival at Kikori.";ca 10:45;PADC/Pilatus Britten-Norman BN-2T Islander;Sunbird Aviation PNG;Wednesday 23 April 2014

There were eight passengers on board and one pilot. One passenger was killed in the accident.
During the takeoff run on runway 33, the aircraft's airspeed indicator initially rose as the aircraft accelerated and its nose wheel lifted off the runway. The flaps were set to 20° and the engine produced rated power. During the takeoff roll, the aircraft encountered several soft spots near the taxiway intersection. The pilot applied rearward pressure on the control yoke and one or both main wheels briefly lifted off the runway, but the airspeed stopped increasing and the aircraft did not remain airborne. The pilot rejected the takeoff with an estimated 600 feet of runway remaining. The pilot selected engine power to idle, reverse propeller thrust, and flaps to 0° to maximize braking traction. The aircraft continued past the end of runway 33. The aircraft was travelling at a relatively low speed but the pilot was unable to stop before the aircraft dropped off the steep slope and proceeded down an embankment before coming to rest in a ravine. As a result of the impact, the aircraft was damaged and its fuel system was compromised. A post-crash fire ensued.

The aircraft landed safely on runway 27 and was about to vacate the runway via taxiway N9 when the right main landing gear collapsed. There were no injuries to any person onboard the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.
The landing was carried out by co-pilot and captain was carrying out Supervised Line Flying (SLF). During landing flare, aircraft floated a little and the touchdown was normal. The aircraft landed with a  vertical acceleration of 1.44 G. About 16 seconds after touch down, at a speed of around 58 kts, there was right roll of 4.57° and the aircraft started veering to the right with a noise which felt like a tire burst to the cockpit crew. To maintain directional control first officer moved the tiller. The aircraft vacated via taxiway N9 and stopped on the taxiway with the tail of the aircraft not fully clear of runway 27. Taxiway N9 is about 2600 meters/8550 feet down the runway 27.
Flaps were moved to 40, in case if the situation warranted an evacuation. Thereafter, the captain contacted the Jet Airways dispatcher. Also, the APU was started and engine no.2 was shut down, followed by engine no.1. 
Meanwhile the airport fire service attended as the ATC controller had observed sparks from the right side of the aircraft after landing. On arrival of passenger stairs, the occupants were safely disembarked through the L1 door and no emergency evacuation was carried out.

An investigation revealed that a main landing gear aft trunnion pin had failed as a result of improper grinding during overhaul. Several trunnion pins were overhauled by the same company. The first failure occurred on April 13, 2015 to a Jet Airways Boeing 737-800. During landing rollout at Khajuraho Airport, the left hand main gear aft trunnion pin failed. 
Accoring to maintenance records two sets of trunnion pins had been overhauled. As a precautionary measure, on 20 August 2015, the aft trunnion pins of VT-JGC were removed from the aircraft. After the accident involving VT-JGD, it appeared from maintenance records that in fact three sets of trunnion pins (including VT-JGD) had been overhauled by the same company.";21:52;Boeing 737-95R;Jet Airways;Thursday 3 March 2016

The purpose of the flight was to check the rudder trim indicator and to confirm a potential synchronization problem between the autopilot and the global positioning system (GPS). 
At approximately 17:14, once the tests were completed, the aircraft, which was about 25 nautical miles (nm) south of St-Hubert Airport, set a direct course for St-Hubert Airport. At 17:16, the pilot advised air traffic control (ATC) that the tests had been completed and asked to return to St-Hubert Airport with a simulated instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 24R.
At 17:22:52, the propeller sound fluctuated, as the fault warning light and RH FUEL PRESSURE light illuminated. The pilot noted that the engine nacelle fuel tank gauges showed E (empty). The pilot activated the left and right auxiliary boost pumps and opened the crossfeed valve. At 17:23:44, the aircraft intercepted the localizer of runway 24R at St-Hubert Airport at an altitude of 2800 feet asl. At 17:23:58, the propeller sound fluctuated again, and the right engine stopped.
At 17:24:04, when the aircraft was 2.5 nm northwest of Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil Airport and 2600 feet asl with a ground speed of 190 knots, the pilot advised the controller they were going to land at there instead of St-Hubert. At 17:24:34, when C-GJSU was 2400 feet asl, 7.4 nm away from the runway and on a path toward St-Hubert, the left engine stopped. The pilot initiated a left turn toward the new destination. Over the next 40 seconds, C-GJSU's ground speed dropped from 180 knots to 110 knots.
At 17:24:47, the controller provided traffic information to C-GJSU and cleared C-GJSU to the enroute frequency. The pilot acknowledged immediately. There was no further communication by C-GJSU.
During the turn, when the aircraft was at the highest point of the turn at 1600 feet asl, the pilot lowered the landing gear. When C-GJSU was 1000 feet asl, the stall warning horn sounded, then sounded 3 more times over the next 10 seconds. When the aircraft was approximately 450 feet above ground level (agl) and 0.85 nm from the threshold of runway 15, the pilot decided to land in a field to the right. Twelve seconds before impact, the pilot warned the maintenance engineer, who was seated in the co-pilot seat, that a forced landing was imminent. At that point, the engineer was not aware that the engines had stopped. The engineer immediately alerted the other 2 passengers that a forced landing was imminent and warned them to hold on tight.
Four seconds later, C-GJSU experienced an aerodynamic stall. The right wing touched the ground at an angle of approximately 45°, then the aircraft hit a fence and a tree before severing 2 electrical wires and violently striking the grass-covered ground. The aircraft kept moving for another 120 feet before coming to a stop on its belly. The 4 occupants, who sustained minor injuries, egressed by means of the emergency exit on the right side of the aircraft, which was extensively damaged.

Th investigation learned that, while preparing for the flight, the pilot relied exclusively on the fuel gauges, misread them, and assumed that the aircraft had enough fuel on board for the flight. During the flight, the pilot did not monitor the fuel gauges and, when returning to the airport, decided to extend the flight to practice a simulated instrument landing approach, without noticing there was insufficient fuel to complete it.
The investigation found the pilot had a history of performance that did not meet expected standards to act as pilot-in-command for that aircraft type. Despite a marginal performance during the check flight, the pilot had successfully passed a pilot proficiency check, and TC had approved the individual's appointment to the position of chief pilot.
Meanwhile, the company's operations manager, who had no previous experience in commercial air carrier operations, was unable to fully appreciate the significance of the chief pilot's marginal performance or to detect deviations from regulations in the commercial flights performed over the company's first three months of operations, which preceded the accident. The regulator, Transport Canada, had also approved the appointment of the operations manager.
In addition, the investigation revealed that the person responsible for maintenance (PRM), a new co-pilot on the company's BE10, had no previous experience in maintenance or in air taxi flight operations. Transport Canada had also approved the appointment of the PRM.
The TSB determined that Transport Canada's appointment approval process was not effective and that, once the appointments had been approved, the management team's inability to perform the duties and responsibilities was not grounds for Transport Canada to revoke them.";17:26;Beechcraft 100 King Air;Aviation Flycie;Monday 10 June 2013

Both crew members were killed.
The aircraft was refuelled to capacity at Polokwane Airport, South Africa on 28 June 2004 with 1750 litres of Jet A1 fuel where after it flew to São Sebastião, near Vilanculos, Mozambique. Later the day on 28 June 2004 the crew attempted to take off on a non-scheduled flight from Sao Sebastiao (near Vilanculos) to Vilanculos Airport (VNX).
The purpose of the fight was to airlift an injured man to a hospital at an unknown destination.
The crew did not use the full runway length available but attempted the takeoff run with only 870ft (265 m) of runway available. The aircraft failed to become airborne and overran the runway, colliding with a sandbank, the perimeter fence and trees and erupted in fire.
Calculations, using the takeoff performance graphs in the POH (Pilot Operating Handbook), showed that the aircraft would have required a ground roll distance of 2000 ft (610 m) with 40° flap and 2100 ft (640 m) with no flap selected.";15:10 UTC;Beechcraft 200 Super King Air;Ngangeni Air Charters;Monday 28 June 2004

The aircraft in question was owned by Mr Yu. M Kabanov, deputy director of the Aviation Complex Myachkovo (AKM) and used by the Borki Air Club. On the day of the accident 23 skydivers boarded the Let 410. This was illegal since the maximum number of skydivers allowed on a Let 410 is 12 with lateral seating. In this case nearly all skydivers were sitting on the airplane's floor, one even occupied the toilet. As a result the airplane was overloaded by 618 kg and the centre of gravity was probably about 32% MAC where the maximum rear CofG was 28% MAC. At an altitude of about 3900 metres eleven skydivers prepared to exit the plane. When four of them had gotten out the CofG moved further aft (probably to about 35%) causing the Let to pitch up. The plane stalled, fell to the left and descended out of control. At an altitude of 2000 metres the aft fuselage section failed.

The pilot, co-pilot, 3 flight attendants, and 68 passengers on board were not injured. The airplane received substantial damage. The flight originated from New York-LaGuardia Airport (LGA), at 06:18.
The accident flight was the first one for the airplane after having maintenance performed on the number two (right) engine during the previous evening. The first officer reported he used a flashlight when conducting his preflight inspection of the airplane as it was still dark outside. He reported the engine cowlings were flush, and he did not see any ""hanging"" cowl latches when he looked underneath the engines.
The captain reported that the logbooks indicated the number two engine vibration monitor had been replaced during the previous night. He reported the preflight, taxi, and takeoff were normal. The captain reported that during climb out the cockpit received a call from the lead flight attendant who informed them that a passenger reported that the number two engine cowling was flapping after takeoff. A pilot-passenger who was sitting behind this passenger reportedly did not see the cowling move, nor did the flight attendants when they looked out the window. The captain reported he then began to monitor the N1 vibration indications on the number two engine. He reported that the number two engine vibration was approximately double the indication from the number one engine, but the indicator was not flashing nor had it turned amber. During cruise flight the number two engine vibration decreased to equal that of the number one engine. The captain reported that about 20 minutes after they leveled off, the airplane shuddered as if flying through wake turbulence. He reported the remainder of the flight was normal until they were taxiing after landing and the lead flight attendant called the cockpit stating that ""part of the right engine had come off."" The first officer called ground control to warn them that there might be debris on the runway. The crew then shut down the number two engine and taxied to the gate. 
The pilot of another airplane later reported seeing part of the engine cowling come off when flight 853 was on a 1-mile final. The other half of the engine cowling was found on the runway and was contacted by an airplane that landed after the accident airplane. 
Contract maintenance personnel reported they changed the N1 sensor on the number two engine during the evening prior to the accident. They reported they then shut the fan cowling, but did not latch it as they still needed to perform an engine run and check for leaks. After the engine run was performed, one of the mechanics thought that the other had latched the fan cowling when in fact he had not. While they were doing another task in the cockpit, another mechanic asked for help at another gate. The mechanics left the accident airplane to assist the other mechanic. Neither mechanic returned to the accident airplane to either latch or verify that the fan cowling had been latched. 
The maintenance log stated the N1 speed sensor was removed and replaced in accordance with aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) 77-11-10. This section of the AMM states, ""Close the fan cowl doors (Ref. AMM TASK 71-13-00-410-040)."" According to the maintenance personnel, this task was not completed prior to the airplane being returned to service. 
The separated cowling contacted the right side of the horizontal stabilizer which resulted in substantial damage to the stabilizer. In addition, the fan cowl doors, number two engine pylon, the number two engine reverser, and the right wing number one slat were damaged.";07:49;Airbus A319-114;Northwest Airlines;Wednesday 9 January 2008

There were no injuries among the 202 passengers and 13 crew members.
Flight AF470 took off from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) at 08:55 UTC on a regular service to Caracas, Venezuela. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Weather at the destination was poor due to the presence of several thunderstorms and rain. The captain was pilot flying during the ILS approach to runway 10 at Caracas.
The airplane was aligned with the localizer at 10 NM from the threshold and the glideslope was intercepted at 6 NM. The crew selected a Vapp approach speed of 136 kts and moments later disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle. Passing 1000 feet above aerodrome level the crew was able to observe the runway. Descent rate at the time was -950 feet per minute and the airplane had rolled 3° to the right at an airspeed of 153 kt (Vapp + 17 kt). Shortly before passing 500 feet the captain had to correct some deviations, causing roll angles reaching 9°. At 200 feet the airplane was above the glide path and the pilot monitoring reported that the airspeed increased from 138 kt to 153 kt. The airspeed decreased again to below 136 kts with the GPWS warning ""Sink Rate!"" at 35 feet.
The airplane touched down at 2,74 G with a descent rate of -1200 ft/min.
Flight 470 taxied to the terminal without any problems. The captain reported the hard landing in the Aircraft Technical Log and reported it to the station manager at Caracas. One Air France technician performed a walk around check in very heavy rain and low light conditions. The Aircraft Condition Monitoring System (ACMS) did not generate an automated 'hard landing' report, and no report was received at the company's Maintenance Control Center (MCC). The Data Management Unit (DMU), part of the ACMS was checked and it was concluded that there was no defect. Consequently, the airplane was released for the return flight to Paris.
Upon takeoff from Caracas at 18:30 local time, the crew were not able to raise the undercarriage. Several alarms related to cabin conditioning were triggered and displayed on the ECAM. After burning off fuel the crew landed safely back at Caracas. After parking, significant damage was found on the right hand main landing gear and fuselage structure.";13:55;Airbus A330-203;Air France;Wednesday 13 April 2011

The cabin of the aircraft was configured for cargo operations with no passenger seats fitted, as the only other planned occupant was the operator’s Chief Engineer, who would be sitting beside the commander in the right hand seat. However, the commander asked the operator if he could take a family member with him to SXM. The operator agreed and an extra seat was fitted. Witnesses stated that the commander appeared ""rushed"" prior to departure.
The commander stated that he partially carried out the normal pre-flight inspection. He then started the engines. Before taxiing he realised that the nose landing gear chocks were still in place so he shut down the left hand engine, removed and stowed the chocks and then restarted the left engine.
The aircraft took off from runway 10 at 14:15 hrs. At between 100 ft and 150 ft the commander initiated a left turn but after some initial movement the ailerons jammed. When he discovered that he was unable to straighten the ailerons he attempted to return to land on runway 10. The other flight controls did not appear to be restricted.
With the ailerons jammed, the aircraft continued to turn to the left, losing altitude as it flew over a settlement to the north of the aerodrome, until pointed directly at the Air Traffic Control tower, causing the Air Traffic Control Officer (ATCO) to abandon the tower. The commander judged that the aircraft was too fast and high to attempt a landing and therefore initiated a go-around, applying full power. He continued the left turn, losing height and speed to position the aircraft for another approach but, as the aircraft descended over the northern edge of the runway, its left wing struck the perimeter fence.

On the morning of the occurrence, CA66's first officer arrived at the airport at approximately 06:00. The first officer appeared to be in good spirits and spent about 5 minutes in the flight planning room before going to the aircraft to prepare it for that day's flights. The captain arrived at approximately 06:15 and went directly to the flight planning room to begin preparing the morning's flight plan. He appeared to be in a positive state of mind and spent a few minutes speaking with other company pilots who were also preparing to operate flights. He used a company computer to access weather information and placed a telephone call to NAV CANADA to file an instrument flight rules flight plan. No abnormal behaviour was observed by anyone with whom he had contact. The captain then walked to the aircraft and spent about 10 minutes in the flight deck before assisting the first officer with loading the flight's cargo. Final flight preparations were carried out by both flight crew members before they boarded the aircraft and started the engines, at about 06:45.
At 07:03, CA66 began its take-off run. The aircraft lifted off after an approximate ground-run distance of 2800 to 3000 feet. This was within the expected normal performance for the aircraft type.
Shortly after takeoff, CA66 contacted CYVR terminal departure control and was cleared to 9000 feet above sea level (ASL). A short time later, the air traffic controller assigned the flight a northbound heading. At 07:07, CYVR terminal departure control instructed CA66 to change radio frequencies and contact CYVR centre control. Upon initial contact with CYVR centre control, while climbing through 7500 feet, CA66 was again cleared to the aircraft's final flight planned altitude of flight level 200. At 07:08, the crew acknowledged a clearance to climb to flight level 200; this was CA66's last radio transmission. One minute and 20 seconds later, while climbing through an altitude of 8700 feet on an assigned heading of 350° magnetic, the aircraft disappeared from secondary surveillance radar displays at air traffic control.
CA66's radar track, from the time it first became visible on radar at 07:02 until a steep descent toward ground, was approximately 7 minutes. The track showed an apparently routine climb from CYVR, at an average climb rate of 1500 feet per minute. Aircraft speed during the climb increased gradually until a ground speed of approximately 185 knots was reached.
The last 3 radar returns from CA66 showed the aircraft beginning an abrupt, steep descent. At 07:09, a radar return showed that the aircraft was at 8700 feet; this was the highest altitude it reached. The 2 subsequent radar returns showed that the aircraft had dropped rapidly to 7600 feet and then 5000 feet while continuing in the direction of flight. There were no further returns.
During the initial stage of the descent, the aircraft pitched down at about 6° per second, and its vertical acceleration reached -0.6g. The descent to 5000 feet likely occurred within 10 to 14 seconds. During that period, the aircraft's descent rate exceeded 30 000 feet per minute, and aerodynamic forces caused structural disintegration of the aircraft (in-flight breakup). There was no Mayday call or other communication from the aircraft during this period.
Deteriorating weather conditions with low cloud and heavy snowfall hampered an air search; however, aircraft wreckage was found on steep, mountainous, snow-covered terrain by ground searchers at approximately 16:45. Both pilots had been fatally injured.

Investigation showed that the captain had 0.24% blood alcohol content [BAC]. To obtain this, the captain would have had to consume approximately 17 to 20 standard drinks over a 12-hour period. 
An autopsy also identified focal severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and both steatosis and hepatitis in the captain’s liver. Finding these conditions in a 34-year-old person suggests excessive alcohol consumption over a significant period.
The captain had recently applied for the position of Vancouver base chief pilot for the company’s cargo operation. On 26 March 2015, the company advised him that the position had been awarded to another candidate. Around the same period, on 24 March 2015, 20 days before this accident, a first officer who had been having symptoms of depression and psychosis deliberately flew a Germanwings Airbus A320 into terrain, killing all on board.
Although there were several coincidental factors, the investigation could not make any conclusions about the captain’s predisposition to committing an intentional act. Other scenario's like pitot system blockage or crew incapacitation were also considered, but deemed not very probable.";07:09;Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II;Carson Air;Monday 13 April 2015

The captain then briefed for a NDB/DME approach for runway 36. The initial approach was normal and the crew were VMC at a range of approximately 8 nm from the airfield. At this stage the captain was certain of his geographical position and, with the agreement of his first officer, decided to continue visually. Although they were in sight of the surface, there appeared to be some patchy cloud in the direction of the airfield and neither pilot could see the runway. Descent was continued and flaps set to 15 degrees. At that point the flight was level at the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 430 feet amsl. Visual contact with the runway was acquired and the PAPI showed four whites. The captain considered going around, but, considering the length of Stornoway runway (7218 feet / 2200 m), decided to land. Full flaps were selected. On finals the speed fluctuated between +10 and -5 relating to the 103 kts landing speed. Touchdown was 'firm'. The crew heard a 'bang' and the left side of the aircraft went down.

The maintenance facility released the Sabreliner to the pilots on February 1. The Sabreliner was located on the maintenance facility ramp in the northwest corner of Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport. The pilot and copilot boarded the airplane, started the APU, and started both engines.
About 15:40, the Sabreliner began to taxi out, and contacted the FXE ATCT ground controller to coordinate maneuvering around a Cessna Caravan that was headed in the opposite direction on the same ramp. The ground controller replied ""...don't have you in sight if you guys are in the foxtrot one ramp that is uncontrolled."" The accident crew responded that they were aware of that, but that they wanted to ""get out of the way"" of the Caravan. Ground control then asked for the accident crew's intentions, and at 15:42:04, the accident crew replied ""taxi out for departure and I'll get the clearance as soon as I get clear of the Caravan.""

Dark, night time conditions existed at the time of the accident.
The ATR-42-600, operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri and registered PK-TNJ, was parked at stand B-1 on the north apron of Halim Airport and was to be moved from the north to the south apron. For this the aircraft had to cross the active runway.
A towing car was used with a driver and one supporting personnel. Two engineers occupied the pilot seats in the aircraft. The engineers were assigned to apply aircraft brakes if required during the towing process.
The towed aircraft was towed without aircraft electrical power fed to the system and the navigation light, strobe light and the aircraft radio communications were off. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was performed by a handheld radio communication on frequency 152.7 MHz.
At 19:45 local time flight ID7703 requested pushback clearance to the Halim Tower controller on frequency 118.6 MHz. The aircraft was parked on parking stand B-2 and was approved to push back. 
After the ID7703 completed the pushback, the towing car driver of the towed aircraft requested clearance to Halim Tower Control Unit to reposition from parking stand B-1 to the south apron. The towing car driver was instructed to follow ID7703 and to report when on taxiway C. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was handled by the assistant controller.
The controller heard the communication between the assistant and towing car driver, he recognized the position of the towed aircraft was on the parking stand B-1. 
The ID7703 flight crew did not know that there was a towing aircraft behind as communications with the car were on a different frequency. At 19:48, ID7703 received taxi clearance to runway 24 via taxiway C.
At 19:50, the controller instructed ID7703 to hold on taxiway C due to an arriving aircraft. The assistant stated that when ID7703 was holding on short taxiway C, the towing car began moving the ATR-42.
At 19:53, ID7703 received clearance from controller to enter runway 24 to back track for departure. The aircraft that had just arrived would use parking stand B-1. Therefore, the assistant controller instructed the towing car driver to expedite the tow and report when on taxiway C. The controller was not observing the ATR at that time. The towing car was about to enter taxiway C at that time.
At 19:56, ID7703 reported ready for takeoff. The controller did not see any vehicle or object on the runway then issued clearance for takeoff. The pilot stated that during line up, the lights surrounding the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision for a short time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the threshold runway 24.
After receiving the takeoff clearance, the Second in Command (SIC) as pilot flying (PF) opened the power and pressed the Take Off / Go Around (TOGA) button.
The towing car driver stated that, when he saw ID7703 was lining up for takeoff, he asked Halim Tower whether ID7703 was initiating the takeoff. There was no reply from Halim Tower. The towing car driver then sped up the towing and turned to the right side of the runway.
When ID7703 was accelerating through approximate 80 knots, the SIC saw an object warned the captain. The pilots could not identify the object but later on when the object became closer, the SIC realized that there was an aircraft.
The captain took over control and applied the right rudder towards the right side of runway centerline and maintained a course between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The PIC intended to reject the takeoff shortly after they felt an impact. The impact occurred at a ground speed of about 130 knots, after passing V1. The pilot rejected takeoff and the aircraft stopped at approximately 400 meter from the towed aircraft which stopped at the left of the runway 24 centerline at approximately 100 meters from taxiway G.
The captain noticed fire on the left wing tip and immediately shut down both engines, activated the fire extinguishers of both engines and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and commanded to the flight attendant ""evacuation from the right"".
The flight attendants opened all aircraft passenger doors and the escape slides deployed. Most of passengers were evacuated from the left forward door (L1).
Both aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no reported injuries to the accident. 
The outer portion of the left wing of the Boeing 737, about 5,75 m, was severed. The ATR-42s left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine, was severed, along with the entire empennage.";19:57;Boeing 737-8GP (WL);Batik Air;Monday 4 April 2016

The aircraft came to rest on the right side of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed and the right hand wing tip was bent.
Kalaupapa Airport is an uncontrolled (nontowered) airport with a single runway and no taxiways. The pilots use a common frequency to state their intentions. 
The pilot of the Grand Caravan reported that she was going to establish an approach and landing to runway 05. While on a seven-mile final, she communicated with the pilot of an airplane that was on short final for the same airport. The pilot that was on short final reported that he would report when he was clear of the runway, and he did. The commuter pilot acknowledged the other pilot's clear of runway transmission, and initiated the approach. 
As the pilot descended through 150 feet above ground level, she noticed that the airplane that she had communicated with was not clear of the runway. The airplane on the ground was near the runway 23 numbers with the propeller turning, facing toward her landing airplane. She aborted the landing but the airplane did not climb. The airplane impacted the runway hard and bounced. She reported that when the airplane touched down after the bounce, she ""applied left rudder pedal to steer the aircraft off the runway and out of the way of the other aircraft's possible flight path."" The airplane exited the left side of the runway and ground-looped to the left. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right side of the fuselage and the right wing. 
After the ground-loop, the pilot of the airplane near the runway 23 numbers attempted to takeoff. He was contacted via radio transmission by the airport manager and vehemently told that the runway was closed until further notice.";08:30;Cessna 208B Grand Caravan;Makani Kai Air;Saturday 11 March 2017

At 05:45, the aircraft departed Halifax for St. John's. The pilot flying was completing his line indoctrination training after having recently upgraded to captain. En route the crew were advised of a NOTAM that the ILS for runway 11 was unserviceable. Because of the marginal weather, the loss of runway 11/29, and his greater experience, the training captain decided to switch seats and assume the duties and full responsibilities as captain and pilot flying.
Clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16 was obtained from Gander ACC, and the crew was advised to contact St. John's tower. Just over two minutes before landing, the tower advised that the wind was 050º (estimated) at 20, gusting to 35, knots. The aircraft crossed the final approach fix on the ILS glideslope at 150 KIAS. During the final approach, the airspeed steadily increased to 180 KIAS (ground speed 190 knots); the glidepath was maintained with a descent rate of 1000 feet per minute. From 1000 feet above sea level, no airspeed calls were made; altitude calls were made and responses were made. The Royal Boeing 737 operations manual states that the PNF shall call out significant deviations from programmed airspeed. In the descent, through 900 feet above sea level, the aircraft encountered turbulence resulting in uncommanded roll and pitch deviations and airspeed fluctuations of ±11 knots. At about 300 feet above decision height, the crew acquired visual references for landing. They were cleared to land. The aircraft touched down at 164 KIAS (27 KIAS above the desired touchdown speed of Vref), 2300 to 2500 feet beyond the threshold. The wind at this point was determined to be about 050º at 30 knots. Shortly after touchdown, the speed brakes and thrust reversers were deployed. With approximately 1100 feet of runway remaining, through a speed of 64 KIAS, reverse thrust increased to about 1.97 EPR on engine 1 and 2.15 EPR on engine 2. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft to the right, toward the Delta taxiway intersection. Twenty-two seconds after touchdown, the aircraft exited the departure end of the runway into deep snow. The aircraft came to rest approximately 75 feet beyond and 53 feet to the right of the runway centreline.
The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. The aircraft sustained serious damage to the landing gear and the left engine detached from the wing.

The company had had a great deal of experience with this type of operations, and had been carrying out parachute drops in Norway each summer for the last 9 years. 
On Friday morning, 16 July 2004, the weather conditions were good when the flights started. They first performed six routine drop flights. After stopping to fill up with fuel, normal preparations were made for the next flight with 20 parachutists who were to jump in two groups of 10.
The seventh departure was carried out at time 13:05. The Commander asked for and was given clearance by the air traffic control service to climb to flight level FL150. The parachutists were then dropped from that altitude. The first drop of 10 parachutists was made on a southerly course above the airstrip, and the aircraft continued on that course for a short time before turning through 180° and getting ready for the next drop at the same location on a northerly course.
A large cumulonimbus cloud (CB), with precipitation, had approached the airfield from the north at this time. To reach the drop zone above the runway, the aircraft had to fly close to this cloud. The aircraft was not equipped with weather radar. The last parachutists to leave the aircraft were in a tandem jump that was being filmed on video. The film showed that the parachutists became covered in a layer of white ice within 2-3 seconds of leaving the aircraft. The ice on the parachutists only thawed once they had descended to lower altitudes where the air temperature was above zero.
Once the parachutists had jumped, the aircraft was positioned close to the CB cloud at a low cruising speed. They were exposed to moderate turbulence from the cloud. The Commander started a sudden 90° turn to the left while also reducing engine power to flight idle in order to avoid the CB cloud and return to Østre Æra to land.
At this point, the First Officer observed that ice had formed on the front windshield, and he chose to switch on the anti-icing system. He did this without informing the commander. A few seconds later both engines stopped, and both propellers automatically adopted the feathered position.
The pilots had not noticed any technical problems with the aircraft engines before they failed. During the descent, the first officer, on the commander's orders, carried out a series of start-up attempts with reference to the checklist/procedure they had available in the cockpit. The engines would not start and the commander made a decision and prepared to carry out an emergency landing at Østre Æra without engines.
The runway at Østre Æra is 600 m long and 10 m wide. The surrounding area is covered by dense coniferous forest and they had no alternative landing areas within reach. Because they were without engine power, there was no hydraulic power to operate the aircraft's flaps. This meant that the speed of the aircraft had to be kept relatively high, approx. 160-180 km/h. The final approach was further complicated because the commander had to avoid the last 10 parachutists who were still in the air and who were steering towards a landing area just beside the airstrip.
The commander first positioned the aircraft on downwind on a southerly course west of the airfield, in order then to make a left turn to final on runway 01. The landing took place around halfway down the runway, at a faster speed than normal - according to the Commander's explanation approximately 160-170 km/h. The commander braked using the wheel brakes, but when he realized that he would not be able to stop on the length of runway remaining, he ceased braking. He knew that the terrain directly on the extension to the runway was rough, and chose to use the aircraft's remaining speed to lift it off the ground and to alter course a little to the right. The aircraft passed over the approx. 2.5 m high embankment in the transition between the runway level and the higher marshy plateau surrounding the northern runway area.
The aircraft ran approx. 230 m in ground effect before landing on its wheels in the flat marshy area north of the airfield. After around 60 m of roll-out, the nose wheel and the aircraft's nose struck a ditch and the aircraft turned over lengthways. It came to rest upside down with its nose section pointing towards the landing strip. The floor of the cockpit was pushed up so that the nose wheel came through the floor and partially into the cockpit.";13:24;Antonov 28;Rigas Aeroklubs;Friday 16 July 2004

Flight RA183 was a domestic flight from Kathmandu to Jumla with a refueling stop at Pokhara. The airplane took off from Pokhara at 12:43. Upon leaving Pokhara Control Zone, the pilot in command realized that the direct track was not possible due weather and decided to proceed via a more southern track. During the flight the pilots were experiencing uncomfortable flying environment due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attempting to avoid the weather, the pilots had to fly up and down and changing the heading. Finally being unable to penetrate the weather ahead, the captain decided to divert to Bhairahawa, the nearest airport. However, the captain did not take into consideration the surrounding terrain and continued descent turning right. 
The aircraft initially slashed a small tree and finally impacted a ridge. Due to the heavy impact the left wing was first disintegrated and then the front part of the aircraft toppled over beyond the ridge with several subsequent impacts.

Flight GL-3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Three passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries.
On initial radio contact with Ilulissat AFIS, the flight crew got the information that runway 07 was in use. Weather information showed wind from 150° magnetic at 24 knots, maximum 33 knots, minimum 17 knots; a 24 knots cross wind, and a headwind of 5 knots. The wind at threshold runway 25 was gusting to 41 knots. Visibility was fine (10 km) with broken clouds at 12000 feet.
The flight crew got visual contact with the Ilulissat area and due to the wind conditions and consequently expected turbulence on final, the flight crew prepared for a NDB/DME approach to runway 07 via JV NDB. Due to the cross wind conditions, the flight crew decided to do a landing with a flap setting of 15°. 
The flight crew asked Ilulissat AFIS for a confirmation of whether or not the cross winds of 24 knots included the gusting wind conditions up to maximum 33 knots. Ilulissat AFIS replied that the maximum wind was 35 knots and the cross wind was 26 knots. 
On a 5 miles final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to be 140° magnetic at 28 knots with a maximum of 35 knots and a cross wind of 26 knots. On short final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to 140° magnetic and 25 knots, maximum to 39 knots. 
Upon touchdown on runway 07, the left main landing gear collapsed. With the left main landing collapsed and after approximately 104 meters of runway rolling, the flight crew started to loose aircraft directional control. After approximately 389 meters, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and into the safety zone. The aircraft skidded sideways, hit the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to runway 25, skidded down a steep slope and impacted a rocky area approximately 10 meters below the runway elevation. 
The crew members initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The flight crew found the flight deck door jammed and evacuated the flight deck through the flight compartment emergency exit hatch. The cabin crew member and a passenger had difficulties opening a partly jammed main entrance door. In cooperation with the commander from the outside of the aircraft, they succeeded. From the outside of the aircraft, the commander opened the forward right hand cabin emergency exit door. The passengers and the cabin crew member evacuated the passenger cabin trough the main entrance door. The overall evacuation took approximately 30-40 seconds.
Ilulissat Airport has a single, 07/25 asphalt runway, 845 m (2772 ft) long. Runway 07 has a 0,8% downslope for the first 550 m, followed by a 0,2% upslope for 295 m.";08:42;de Havilland Canada DHC-8-202Q;Air Greenland;Wednesday 29 January 2014

The flight crew reported that the airplane was about 60 pounds over its maximum weight for takeoff. Since their taxi to the assigned runway was long, they decided to reduce weight by using higher-than-normal engine power settings while maintaining some amount of braking to control speed while taxiing in order to burn fuel prior to takeoff. During the taxi, the right and left main landing gear tires deflated when the fusible plugs in the wheels blew out due to over-heating, and a fire ignited in the right wheel housing. The crew reported that they felt the airplane yaw as the tires deflated and were informed via radio by a following airplane that their right wheel was on fire. The crew brought the airplane to a stop on the taxiway, evacuated, and attempted to extinguish the fire with two hand-held fire extinguishers.

When the pilot in command placed the landing gear lever to the ""down"" position, a loud thump was heard and the ""gear safe"" green light for the right main gear illuminated immediately. This was followed by the illumination of the left main and nose landing gear lights, consistent with a normal extension sequence. The aircraft rolled approximately 4 degrees to the right while the gear was extending. This was counteracted by a left roll control input.
As the crew had received indications that the landing gear was safely locked down, they continued the approach and completed a normal landing.
Ramp maintenance staff briefly inspected the aircraft but did not find any immediate cause for the reported thump. The aircraft was then placed on jacks for a retraction test. When the landing gear lever was selected to the ""up"" position, the right main landing gear moved inboard approximately 15 cm before a grinding noise was heard.

The aircraft took off from Tekin Airport at 13:56 hours local time on a VFR flight to Kiunga. On board were the pilot-in-command and 11 passengers: eight adults and three infants. In addition to the passengers and their baggage, the aircraft was carrying a significant quantity of vegetables. 
The weather at Kiunga was reported to be fine. As the aircraft entered the Kiunga circuit area, the pilot cancelled SARWATCH with Air Traffic Services (ATS). The pilot did not report an emergency to indicate a safety concern. Witnesses reported that during its final approach, the aircraft suddenly pitched up almost to the vertical, the right wing dropped, and the aircraft rolled inverted and rapidly ""fell to the ground"". It impacted the terrain about 1,200 metres west of the threshold of runway 07. The impact was vertical, with almost no forward motion. The aircraft was destroyed, and all occupants were fatally injured.
The investigation found that the right-wing fuel tank was empty. There was no evidence of pre- or postimpact fuel leakage. The backing plate behind the fuel selectors was bent during the impact, and had jammed the left selector in its selected position. It appeared that the pilot may have been cross feeding fuel from the left-wing tank to feed the right engine.
The aircraft had been reweighed 5 months prior to the accident. The operator had not sought to obtain CASA approval of the new weight and balance data sheet for inclusion in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). There was no evidence that the pilot had computed load distribution within the aircraft. The investigation determined that while the aircraft was within the weight limitations, the load distribution placed it in a significantly aft centre of gravity (c of g) situation for takeoff and landing. 
The investigation determined that the right engine had failed, probably subsequent to the SARWATCH broadcast, but sufficiently before the aircraft pitched nose up, in order for the pilot to have had time to wind in full nose-left rudder trim to counteract the aerodynamic forces imposed by the failure of the right engine.";ca 14:20;PADC/Pilatus Britten-Norman BN-2T Islander;Sunbird Aviation PNG;Wednesday 13 April 2016

The weather conditions at Edinburgh Airport were wintry with snowfall, which required the aircraft to be de-iced. Shortly after both engines had been started, the commander signalled to the marshaller to remove the Ground Power Unit (GPU) from the aircraft, which was facing nose out from its stand, down a slight slope. As the marshaller went to assist his colleague to remove the GPU to a safe distance prior to the aircraft taxiing off the stand, the aircraft started to move forward slowly, forcing them to run to safety. The flight crew, who were looking into the cockpit, were unaware that the aircraft was moving. It continued to move forward until its right propeller struck the GPU, causing substantial damage to the GPU, the propeller and the engine. The ground crew were uninjured.;21:15;Fokker F-27 Friendship 500;MNG Airlines;Saturday 2 February 2008

Flight SI-308 took off from Guernsey, Channel Islands at 07:05, with the captain acting as pilot flying. He was conducting line training of the co-pilot, a first officer who had recently joined the company.
The short flight to Jersey was without incident and the weather for landing was reported as good, with the wind from 210° at 16 kt, few clouds at 2,000 ft and visibility in excess of 10 km. The commander elected to carry out a visual approach to runway 27 at Jersey, using a planned approach speed of 107 kt and flap 30 selected for landing.
During the approach, the gear was selected down and the flight crew confirmed the three green 'gear safe' indication lights were illuminated, indicating that the gear was locked in the down position. The commander reported that both the approach and touchdown seemed normal, with the crosswind from the left resulting in the left main gear touching first.
Just after touchdown both pilots heard a noise and the aircraft appeared to settle slightly differently from usual. The captain considered that a tyre had burst. The cabin crewmember also heard a noise after touchdown which she too thought was from a tyre bursting. The commander selected ground idle and partial reverse pitch and, as the aircraft decelerated through 70 kt, the co-pilot took over control of the ailerons, as per standard procedures, to allow the commander to take control of the steering tiller. Despite applying corrective inputs the aircraft continued rolling to the left. 
The aircraft continued to quickly roll to the left until the left wingtip and propeller contacted the runway. The aircraft remained on the runway, rapidly coming to a halt to the left of the centreline, approximately abeam Holding Point D. Both propellers continued to rotate and the commander selected the condition levers to the fuel shutoff position and pulled the fire handles to shut both engines down. 

It was determined that the left side brace upper arm had suffered a fatigue failure. The failure rendered the side brace ineffective and the unrestrained main trunnion continued to translate outboard, leading to the collapse of the gear. The aluminium brace was found to contain a small metallurgical feature at the crack origin which was consistent with titanium rich particles (TiB2) particles which are introduced as a grain refiner during casting of the billet prior to forging. The size of the feature was within the defined specifications for AL7010-T74. Analysis of the area surrounding the crack origin revealed an area of static loading before propagating a crack in fatigue, indicating that there may have been a single overload event at some point in the history of the side brace upper arm.";08:23;ATR 42-320;Blue Islands;Saturday 16 June 2012

The flight that had been initially planned for 26th February 2007, was postponed several times due to adverse meteorological conditions, causing problems with provision supply on Ruhnu island. On Friday, 3rd March, pilot checked the weather at 15:00 and at 16:00. Based on the received information the pilot decided to depart for Ruhnu at 16:00.
At 16:08, the aircraft took off from Pärnu airport with a pilot, two passengers and 520 kg of cargo on board. According to the weather briefing received by the pilot via telephone from Kuressaare, at 16:00 the cloud height in Kuressaare (EEKE, 36 Nm northwest of Ruhnu) was 600 ft. and 180 m (approximately 540 ft.) in Ruhnu. During the uneventful flight on the altitude 1500 ft., the coast and the ice border were clearly visible. The aircraft stayed clear from the clouds and no signs of icing were noticed by persons on board. Approaching the island from the northeast it was intended by the pilot to use runway 32 for landing. The pilot decided to fly low from east to west across the runway to check the windsock and runway condition. While approaching the island, the pilot descended at the rate of 150 ft/min with low power settings and flaps extended by 1 notch. During descent the horizontal and vertical visibility deteriorated and the flight was continued in IMC. The descent was continued in clouds; therefore the pilot had no visual contact with the ground and horizon. The aircraft broke through the clouds over the coast at a very low altitude (100-120 feet). Trying to maintain safe altitude and speed pilot added power, at the same time stall warning signal activated and seconds later the lower part of aircraft's fuselage touched the treetops and collided with the terrain at 16:36. 
The passengers and pilot escaped the aircraft without assistance and with no injuries.";16:36;Britten-Norman BN-2B-26 Islander;LFH Luftverkehr Friesland Harle;Saturday 3 March 2007

There were no injuries to the 210 passengers or 10 crew members onboard but the airplane received substantial damage.
During the initial approach, the flight encountered gusty wind conditions (16 knots gusting to 24 knots). As a result, the flight crew added an appropriate wind additive to the reference landing speed (Vref). The airplane touched down in the touchdown zone approximately 1,600 feet from the threshold with a recorded normal acceleration (Nz) consistent with a ""firm"" landing. As the main gear touched down, a full nose down column was applied that produced a very high nose-down pitch rate, which resulted in a hard nose gear touchdown. The recorded normal acceleration at nose gear touchdown was 1.8 g, however, the actual load applied at the nose gear was much higher because the accelerometers are located in the main gear wheel well. The peak nose gear load experienced at nose gear contact exceeded the design-limit load by as much as 46%. The recorded normal and pitch accelerations, calculated data, and estimated nose gear loads confirm that the aircraft experienced a bending moment that exceeded both the design requirements and the structural capability of the fuselage.";15:24;Boeing 767-36NER;Royal Air Maroc - RAM;Monday 20 April 2009

Light rain was falling at the time the aircraft taxied. The wind was light with a slight crosswind from the right. Visibility was in excess of 10 KM. The runway was damp and there were several patches of water on the runway.
The pilot reported that the take-off proceeded normally until approximately 50 knots when he disengaged the nose-wheel steering. At this point, the aircraft started to diverge to the right of the centreline. In an attempt to return the aircraft to the centreline the pilot used rudder but this was ineffective. The pilot then rejected the take-off by moving the power levers to idle but the aircraft continued to diverge to the right and departed the sealed surface of the runway.
The pilot used reverse thrust in an attempt to slow the aircraft but this appeared ineffective and the aircraft continued to turn to the right and slide on the wet grass surface. The aircraft by this time was heading for a small levee bank beside a drainage ditch. The pilot assessed that the aircraft would probably climb over the levee bank, so he elected to introduce power on the left engine in an attempt to turn the aircraft before the levee bank. However, this was only partially successful and the aircraft came to rest adjacent to the levee bank facing approximately 180 degrees from the take-off heading.

The five occupants were killed.
The airplane was inbound from Venice Municipal Airport, FL (VNC). 
The Citation was high during the approach to runway 25, performed a go-around, and made a left turn for another approach. During the second approach, the airplane was high again and the approach steepened, nose-down onto the runway. The nosegear touched down approximately half-way down the runway, followed by main gear touchdown. The airplane then bounced and the witnesses heard the engine noise increase. It then banked right and the right wing contacted the ground. The airplane subsequently flipped over off the right side of the runway and a postcrash fire ensued. 
The airplane came to rest in a grassy area, about 50 feet off the right side of the runway, approximately 4,250 feet beyond the approach end of runway 25.

The airplane, operated by Deraya Air Taxi, departed Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ) on a domestic cargo flight to Wamena Airport (WMX).  The captain acted as Pilot Flying and the first officer acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM).
At 06:27 the aircraft departed from Sentani Airport and climbed to the cruising altitude of 12,000 feet. 
The first officer contacted the Wamena Tower controller at 07:01, while the aircraft was approaching Pass Valley point. The controller informed that runway 15 was in use and the weather condition was wind calm, visibility 4 km, low cloud on finals and QNH 1008 mbs. 
At 07:07, the first officer reported they were on final to runway 15. When reporting runway in sight two minutes later, the controller provided the clearance to land.
On short final the aircraft was on heading 140° and was on the right side of the correct flight path. The pilot then rolled to the left up to 20° to align with the runway, then rolled to the right to align with runway 15. This correction was conducted at altitude between 400 to 200 feet AGL.
The aircraft touched down on the centerline. During the landing roll at about 750 meters from the beginning of runway 15 the aircraft veered to the left of the runway shoulder, the pilot recovered by applying the right rudder and asymmetrical reverse thrust but the aircraft continued veer to the left and stopped at about 10 meters on the left shoulder of the runway 15.
The nose landing gear detached and was found on the shoulder at about 250 meter from the aircraft's final position. The main landing gears were broken and all the propellers bent.";07:09;British Aerospace ATP-F;Deraya Air Taxi;Friday 31 May 2013

Flights were planned to verify the fuel flow rates for those tanks. Prior to departure, both flight crews decided that they would join-up after departure in order to take video and still photography of each airplane. N3735W and N372AC departed Milwaukee (MKE) at 15:55 and 16:15, respectively. After departure and clearing MKE airspace, the flight crew of N372AC established radio and visual contact with N3735W. N3735W then proceeded to perform several fly-bys past N372AC who remained on constant headings and altitude. N3735W then came up along the other Shorts' left side and flew in formation with approximately 100-150 feet lateral separation. A pilot of N3735W then announced over the radio that they would turn right and descend below N372AC. During that manoeuver N3735W's left wing impacted the left wing and engine of the other plane. The captain of N372AC attempted to climb in an attempt to avoid impacting N3735W.

The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL220, which was reached at 06:53. Permission to descend was given at 07:12 and at 07:23 the crew started an ILS approach to runway 30. Two minutes later the captain experienced control problems, which he attributed to an autopilot malfunction. An increase in the rate of descent went unnoticed by the crew who tried to find out the cause of the control problems. As the plane was descending over mountainous terrain, the GPWS alarm sounded three times. The approach controller then asked if the flight was established on the localizer and ILS glidepath. The copilot then replied that they had captured the localizer. Approach Control then instructed the crew to contact Bilbao Tower. Contact was not established however. The copilot noticed that they had not captured the glidepath and informed the captain. The airplane´s speed and rate of descent were reduced and a smooth climb was initiated. Six seconds later the airplane flew into the side of the Monte de Santa Marina, some 18 nm (33 km) from Bilbao Airport. The mountain has an altitude of 675 m (2215 ft).;07:28;Embraer EMB-120RT Brasilia;Ibertrans Aérea;Monday 14 January 2002

All Nippon Airways flight 1603 took off from Osaka (ITM) at 08:21 on a regular domestic flight to Kochi. At 08:47 the flight was given clearance to land on runway 32. However, when configuring the aircraft for landing, it appeared that the nose landing gear would not deploy. The approach was abandoned and the airplane entered a holding pattern. The crew members attempted to deploy the nose undercarriage but the attempts failed. Two low passes were flown, at 500 feet over the runway. The crew then attempted to extend the nose landing gear by utilizing acceleration force during a steep turn. When this did not work, a touch-and-go was made so as to apply an impact to the nose landing gear. The flight crew when concluded that they had to make a landing with the nose gear retracted.

On board were 135, mostly French, holidaymakers who were heading home. 
At 04:38 the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 22R for departure. After takeoff, at 04:42, the plane climbed and maneuvered for a procedural left turn to intercept the 306 radial from the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. When the autopilot was engaged the captain made an exclamation and the autopilot was immediately switched off again. The captain then requested Heading Select to be engaged. The plane then began to bank to the right. The copilot then warned the captain a few times about the fact that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right the captain stated ""OK come out"". The ailerons returned briefly to neutral before additional aileron movements commanded an increase in the right bank.
The aircraft had reached a maximum altitude of 5460 feet with a 50 degrees bank when the copilot stated: ""Overbank"". Repeating himself as the bank angle kept increasing. The maximum bank angle recorded was 111 degrees right. Pitch attitude at that time was 43 degrees nose down and altitude was 3470 feet.
The observer on the flight deck, a trainee copilot, called ""Retard power, retard power, retard power"". Both throttles were moved to idle and the airplane gently seemed to recover from the nose-down, right bank attitude. Speed however increased, causing an overspeed warning. At 04:45 the airplane struck the surface of the water in a 24 degrees right bank, 24 degrees nose-down, at a speed of 416 kts and with a 3,9 G load.

The captain, who was the flying pilot, and two of the three passengers were not injured. The first officer and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by JetSuite. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed. The flight originated from San Jose, California, about 14:20 hours local time.
Following an uneventful flight, the flight crew briefed the arrival to the destination airport and set the calculated landing speeds. The captain and the first officer reported that during final approach, it felt like the airplane was 'pushed up' as the wind shifted to a tailwind or updraft before landing near the runway number markings. Upon touchdown, the captain applied the brakes and thought that the initial braking was effective; however, he noticed the airplane was not slowing down. The captain applied maximum braking, and the airplane began to veer to the right; he was able to correct back to the runway centerline, but the airplane subsequently exited the departure end of the runway and traveled down a steep embankment. 

Recorded communication from the cockpit voice and data recorder (CVDR) revealed that during the approach to landing, the flight crew performed the landing checks, and the captain noted difficulty judging the approach. About 1 minute later, the recording revealed that the ground warning proximity system reported ""five hundred"" followed by a ""sink rate, pull up"" alert about 16 seconds later. Data from the CVDR revealed that about 23 seconds before weight-on-wheels was recorded, the airplane was at an indicated airspeed of about 124 knots and descending. The data showed that this approximate airspeed was maintained until about 3 seconds before weight-on-wheels. The recorded data further showed that the approach speed was set to 120 knots, and the landing reference speed (Vref) was set to 97 knots. 

Using the reported airplane configuration and the 3.5-knot headwind that was reported at the time of the approach and landing, calculations indicate that the Vref speed should have been about 101 knots indicated airspeed, which would have required a landing distance of about 3,112 feet. Utilizing the same airplane configuration and wind condition with the flight’s reported 124 knot indicated airspeed just before touchdown, the landing distance was calculated to be about 5,624 feet. The intended runway for landing was 5,132-feet long with a 1.9 percent downward slope gradient, and a 123-foot long overrun area.";15:52;Embraer EMB-500 Phenom 100;JetSuite;Wednesday 25 May 2011

At 14:45 UTC, the Chief Pilot of Chanchangi Airline approached the Air Traffic Controller stating that he would like to fly around the circuit for a training flight. He was told that the visibility was 600 meters which was below the landing minima and was then advised against it. The pilot then suggested that he would carry out a ""Rejected Takeoff"" training.
Additional persons boarded the flight to witness the exercise.
At 15:37 UTC the pilot requested a take off clearance which was granted, and was directed to proceed to the holding point of runway 05. The prevailing visibility was 600 meters and the wind was 090 at 10 knots. Four rejected take off training runs were carried out within an interval of twelve minutes.
In the conditions at Kaduna, a single exercise of a rejected take off would have required a cooling period of at least ten minutes.
At the end of the fourth run, the left main landing gear number 2 brake unit had started to burn. The pilot steered the airplane off the runway into the last taxiway. Fifty meters from the runway 05 threshold the left inner wheel failed and leaving a molten rubber footprint on the taxiway and at the same time the hydraulic fluid of the brake units started to spill tracing an oily track along.

The flights of the day planned for the pilots were from Douw Aturure Airport (WABI), Nabire to Sugapa Airstrip (WAYB) and return for three times. The PIC acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the SIC acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on all these flights.
After the third flight from Nabire to Bilorai, the aircraft landed safely at Sugapa Airstrip. Prior to the departure to Nabire, there was no report or record of aircraft system malfunction and the aircraft was operated within the approved weight and balance envelope. On board the aircraft were two pilots and 11 passengers.
The aircraft departed from in daylight conditions and cruised at an altitude of 10,500 feet. The aircraft was flying in an out through clouds when approaching Nabire.
Over checkpoint BRAVO, the pilot made initial contact with Nabire Tower controller and advised that the aircraft was descending and passed altitude of 6,600 feet.
During descent after checkpoint BRAVO, the pilot noticed development of clouds along the route and decided to avoid the clouds by deviating the aircraft track to the right of the GPS route.
At about 4.5 Nm from NBR VOR/DME, the flight monitoring system of the Spirit Avia Sentosa recorded the aircraft altitude was 2,000 feet.
The PM noticed yellow on the aircraft GPS which meant the terrain was between 1,000 feet and 100 feet below the aircraft altitude and advised the PF. The PF decided to disengage the auto pilot, reduced the rate of descend and continued to get visual reference on ground.
The PM noticed an ""X"" symbol on the GPS which indicated a potential impact point and advised the PF. The PF was continuing the descent and then the second ""X"" appeared on the GPS. A few second later, the PF noticed terrain ahead and pulled the aircraft. The left side of the aircraft impacted a tree.

Despite numerous attempts, the copilot failed to contact Baucau ATS. The flight navigator then called Baucau Tower. A controller, who was present at Baucau aerodrome at the time, but not on operational duty, advised the flight crew that ATS was not available and that landing would be at the discretion of the flight crew. The pilot in command diverted the aircraft from the published inbound track to the Baucau NDB, and descended the aircraft below the published 10 NM MSA. He continued descending the aircraft through the commencement altitude for the published non-precision instrument approach for runway 14, and through the LSALT. 
As the aircraft approached Baucau, the flight crew decided to conduct an overflight of the aerodrome before making a landing approach, and during the overflight, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be. It appeared that the crew did not use the Baucau NDB but used selected data from their instrument approach charts to formulate a user-defined non-precision approach using the onboard global positioning system (GPS). Adding to this, erroneous data on their Jeppesen charts meant the threshold of runway 14 was not where they thought it would be. Had the flight crew followed the non-precision runway 14 NDB approach procedure as published on either the CAD or Jeppesen charts, and not descended below the relevant MDA(H) until visual flight was assured, the position of the runway, as depicted on the Jeppesen charts would have been irrelevant. 
During the overflight and the subsequent (first) landing approach, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be as it was depicted on the Jeppesen charts. The pilot in command discontinued the landing approach, and the flight navigator stated that he would apply a 4 km correction to position the aircraft for a second landing approach to where he thought the runway was located. By applying the 4 km correction, the flight navigator was providing the pilot in command with inaccurate data, and resulted in the aircraft being repositioned towards a point about 1.65 km (0.88 NM) northwest of the actual position of the threshold of runway 14. As the aircraft turned on to the final approach heading during the second landing approach, the flight navigator stated that the aircraft was high on the approach profile, based on his assumption of the location of the threshold of runway 14. The pilot in command increased the rate of descent of the aircraft to about 18 m/sec (3,543 fpm), and stated ‘Increased’. None of the other crewmembers commented on the high rate of descent, or drew the pilot in command’s attention to the fact that the approach was unstabilised at that point. 
The flight engineer misinterpreted the pilot in command’s statement ‘Increased’ to be an instruction for him to increase the engine thrust, and he advanced the thrust levers. It took about 2 seconds for the pilot in command to realise that engine thrust had been increased, and he reacted by calling ‘No, I increased vertical speed’ and reduced the engine thrust. The flight engineer’s action in increasing engine thrust was a significant distraction to the pilot in command at that stage of the flight, and probably diverted his attention from the primary task of flying the aircraft to restoring the thrust to the proper setting.
At about the same time, the aircraft descended through 162 m, which was the published MDH for a straight-in landing on the runway 14 NDB approach. Neither the pilot in command nor the copilot appeared to notice that the aircraft had descended through the MDH, and it is probable that both were distracted by the flight engineer’s erroneous action. 
The high rate of descent continued unchecked until slightly less than 2 seconds before impact. It is probable that the pilot in command and the copilot were each unaware of the high rate of descent, because neither was monitoring the flight instruments while they were looking ahead of the aircraft and trying to establish visual contact with the ground. The pilot in command applied back elevator to increase the aircraft pitch attitude in response to the co-pilot's urgent expression of concern that impact with terrain seemed almost certain. However, the pilot in command did not simultaneously increase the engine thrust, and it remained unchanged. The airplane impacted the ground.

There were no injuries, and aircraft damage was limited to the nose and main landing gear, which was subsequently replaced.
The flight departed Long Beach, CA (LGB) en route to Milan, Italy, with a planned fuel stop in Iqaluit (YFB), Canada. The flight time to Iqaluit was 5 hours and 36 minutes at a cruise altitude of 41 000 feet. The flight en route was uneventful; the outside temperature at the cruising altitude was approximately -60°C.
The first officer was the pilot flying. An ILS/DME approach to runway 35 at Iqaluit was carried out with the autopilot on. The reported surface winds were within the aircraft limitations for a right crosswind with a light tailwind component. A reference speed (VREF) of 114 knots was calculated. The before-landing checklist items were completed 3 miles prior to the final approach fix. The autopilot was disconnected, and the aircraft crossed the threshold at a speed of about 118 knots.
The aircraft touched down approximately 10 feet to the right of the centreline at 21:00. Once the nose wheel contacted the runway, the aircraft veered to the right. The crew applied full left rudder and left brake while selecting left nose steering with the tiller. Thrust reversers were also selected, but the aircraft continued to pull to the right. The aircraft departed the runway 4300 feet from the threshold and came to rest in packed snow 100 feet from the runway edge lights. The nose landing gear (NLG) came to rest in snow reaching the top of the wheel height, and the main landing gear (MLG) came to rest in snow reaching half the wheel height.";21:00;Bombardier BD-100-1A10 Challenger 300;Tri Marine Management Company LLC;Saturday 12 March 2011

The 3-man cockpit crew, 11-person cabin crew, and 220 passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight, between Newark and Brussels Airport (BRU), Belgium. 
Startup and taxi were normal, and during the taxi, the captain again briefed the cockpit crew, and included engine failures, as well as ""non-reject"" situations. The airplane lined up on runway 04L, and the captain applied takeoff power slowly and smoothly. At takeoff decision speed (V1), there was a loud explosion. A white ""engine fail"" light illuminated in front of the captain, and the number 1 engine N1 decreased by 30 percent. Number 2 and number 3 engines appeared normal. 
The captain continued the takeoff, and the landing gear was raised. A red, left main landing gear warning light illuminated on the front panel. The airplane turned to a heading of 010, and slowly climbed to 3,000 feet. During the climb, an airframe vibration developed. 
After level-off, the crew began to troubleshoot the emergency, and found that when the number 3 engine N1 was reduced, the vibration disappeared. Both the number 1 and the number 3 engines remained at reduced power, in relation to number 2, for the rest of the flight. 
Air traffic control personnel provided vectors for a return to Newark. During the return, the crew dumped about 90,000 pounds of fuel. The crew also ran both 1-engine, and 2-engine inoperative checklists, and prepared data cards for both scenarios. 
The captain flew the ILS glideslope down to a full-stop landing, on runway 04R at 20:16. After stopping on the runway, the brakes would not release, so the crew shut down the engines, and the passengers and crew disembarked through the normal deplaning doors.

When the captain rotated the aeroplane for lift-off the tail struck the runway and scraped for some 490 metres until the aeroplane became airborne. The tail strike occurred because the rotation speed was 33 knots less than the 163 knots required for the aeroplane weight. The rotation speed had been mistakenly calculated for an aeroplane weighing 100 tonnes less than the actual weight of 9V-SMT. A takeoff weight transcription error, which remained undetected, led to the miscalculation of the takeoff
data, which in turn resulted in a low thrust setting and excessively slow takeoff reference speeds. The system defences did not ensure the errors were detected, and the aeroplane flight management system itself did not provide a final defence against mismatched information being programmed into it.
During the takeoff the aeroplane moved close to the runway edge and the pilots did not respond correctly to a stall warning.";15:28;Boeing 747-412;Singapore Airlines;Wednesday 12 March 2003

The aircraft slid upright for approximately 1/2 mile following initial ground contact and came to rest on airport property southeast of the runway 10L departure end. The airplane was substantially damaged in the occurrence. The commercial pilot-in-command and three passengers escaped the aircraft without injury; there was no qualified second-in-command aboard. 
The flight originally received an instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance to Hermiston, Oregon. After taxiing out from the parking ramp at a fixed-base operator (FBO), the pilot called Portland ground control and stated he wanted to return to the ramp. 
Witnesses at the FBO reported that after returning to the, the airplane shut down and opened its main entry door, and that one of the aircraft occupants told ground service personnel the aircraft had an engine problem. The aircraft remained there for approximately 5 minutes, then started back up and taxied back out. After taxiing out the second time, the pilot cancelled his IFR flight plan to Hermiston with ATC, and requested and received a VFR clearance to Redmond, where the accident aircraft was based. 
The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recording indicated that the pilot was unable to start the right engine before takeoff, and elected to attempt takeoff with the right engine inoperative. Witnesses reported that the airplane's nose lifted off about 4,100 feet down the runway and that it then became airborne with its wings rocking, attaining a maximum altitude of 5 to 10 feet above the ground before settling back to the ground.
Investigators removed the right engine starter-generator from the engine after the accident and found the starter-generator drive shaft to be fractured. The aircraft has a minimum crew requirement of two, consisting of pilot and copilot; the copilot's seat occupant, a private pilot-rated passenger, did not hold a multiengine rating and thus was not qualified to act as second-in-command of the aircraft.";09:18;Aérospatiale SN.601 Corvette;R.

According to the Technical Log, the aircraft was serviceable when it arrived at Port Moresby at 07:31 hours.
The aircraft was scheduled for flight PX864, from Port Moresby to Tari on the same day. The pilots carried out a normal pre-flight inspection of the aircraft before it was released to service by the licensed engineer on duty. After obtaining a clearance from air traffic control (ATC), P2-ANK departed from runway 14L at 09:04, then made a right turn, and commenced tracking on the 298°R of the Port Moresby VOR for Tari, under IFR procedures. There were 28 passengers, two pilots, and one flight attendant on board. At about 09:20 while 39 nm west-northwest of Port Moresby and passing 20,000 ft during the climb, both pilots heard a bang sound, and felt the aircraft shudder.
The copilot reported that he first thought that it was an engine failure. However, visual checks of the engines and instrument gauges showed that both engines were operating normally. He then did a further quick scan of the instrument panel and said that he saw the ""unsafe left hand main landing gear door indication"" amber light illuminated. He said that he immediately advised the pilot in command (PIC). The copilot then informed ATC of their intention to return to Port Moresby, and that a normal approach and landing was expected. 
The flight attendant then alerted both pilots that the left main landing gear door was open. That confirmed the reason for the illuminated left main landing gear door OPEN Advisory light. The PIC referred to the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) as a precaution, and descended to remain below 15,000 ft, and not above 130 knots.
At 10 nm from Port Moresby, the copilot requested clearance from ATC to track west of Port Moresby to the Daugo Island area, to hold for 30-40 minutes and burn-off fuel, due to the maximum allowable landing weight.
After burning off the excess fuel to achieve a landing weight of 15,650 kgs, they requested a clearance from ATC to continue descent to Jacksons for a landing.
After obtaining a clearance to land the copilot selected the landing gear down. With the landing gear fully extended, the cockpit indication was three green lights illuminated. The copilot conducted a cross-check against the alternate landing gear selection, which showed three green lights illuminated. They proceed to land, assured that the nose- and main- landing gear were safe. At 10:46, the aircraft landed on runway 14L, and was cleared to cross runway 14R to the parking area.
The PIC reported that it was at that moment they realized that everyone on the tarmac was looking at the aircraft, particularly the left side. It wasn’t until the passengers and the crew disembarked, that the crew were advised by the engineers that panels were missing aft of the left exhaust nacelle.
Further inspection found that the left main landing gear number-two tyre was deflated and damaged. It was apparent that when the tyre blew out in the wheel well, it caused substantial damage to the main structure on the inside of the nacelle. It was then the crew realised that the bang sound they heard was the tyre exploding in flight at 20,000 ft.";09:22;de Havilland Canada DHC-8-202Q Dash 8;LinkPNG;Friday 4 August 2017

The aircraft sustained substantial damage. 
The occurrence flight was chartered by a travel agency on behalf of a wilderness adventure ski lodge. It was a regularly occurring charter flight between Vancouver and Blue River, BC, Canada.
The travel agent verbally passed weather information to the flight crew. The captain understood that the runway had been plowed the previous day, and that the weather had been good that morning in Blue River.
Before departing Vancouver, the flight crew had also obtained official weather data from regular flight planning sources. It was noted that although current conditions at Blue River were good, a weather system was moving northbound, and conditions in the area of Kelowna, Kamloops (CYKA) (the alternate), and Blue River would begin to deteriorate. As the flight progressed, the ski lodge radio room operator overheard the flight crew discussing weather conditions with a local helicopter pilot on the ATF as the flight overflew Blue River, but the operator did not have any direct contact with the flight. The crew was satisfied with the information received from the helicopter pilot regarding local weather.
Because the Blue River aerodrome does not have a published instrument approach procedure, the intention was to fly over the aerodrome and proceed under visual flight rules (VFR) into the aerodrome. The flight progressed as planned until the aircraft passed overhead Blue River at the lowest useable IFR altitude, and the pilot was not able to descend under VFR into Blue River.
The pilot then climbed back up to an enroute IFR altitude and continued to Valemount Airport under IFR. After conducting the IFR approach into Valemount and finding the weather suitable for flight under VFR, the aircraft completed the 60-nautical mile (nm) trip back to Blue River visually. The aircraft slowly descended in steps as it flew south towards Blue River at a reduced cruise speed of approximately 175 knots. As the aircraft neared the aerodrome, the pilots descended to altitudes as low as 1100 feet above ground level (agl) to maintain visual contact with the ground in deteriorating weather. Approximately 4 nm from the aerodrome, and 85 seconds before touchdown, control was transferred from the first officer (FO) to the captain, who became the pilot flying (PF).
During the approach, the crew rushed to complete the pre-landing checks, visually acquire the runway, and manoeuvre the aircraft to land. The captain turned slightly to the left, away from the runway centreline. At this point, the FO called visual contact with the runway, and the captain turned right, back towards the runway centreline, and again passed through the runway centreline. The captain did not acknowledge that the runway was in sight.
The aircraft was configured for landing 25 seconds prior to touchdown. As viewed from the pilot's perspective, the aircraft was to the left of centreline. Several seconds later, the aircraft initiated a right turn to line up with the centreline of runway 19, but actually crossed to the right of the centreline. The aircraft then overflew several buildings on the right of the runway centreline, approximately 75 feet adjacent to the runway threshold. The aircraft then turned sharply to the left as it passed abeam the threshold, then sharply right to acquire the centreline before touching down approximately 2000 feet past the threshold. Immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered left into the snow bank.
During the last 23 seconds of the flight, the FO broadcast a traffic advisory to indicate that the aircraft was on final, made 3 speed calls, and advised the captain that the runway was to the left. There were no remarks made by the captain since the request for the landing checklist. The FO did not declare an unstable approach, or prompt the captain to execute a missed approach.";11:29;Beechcraft 1900C;Northern Thunderbird Air;Saturday 17 March 2012

The two pilots and mechanic were not injured. The airplane flew under contract with the United States Forest Service. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for the local flight. 
According to the pilot-in-command (PIC), the flight departed on its third mission to disperse fire retardant over a nearby wildfire. During the airplane's climb, the flight crew increased the airplane's nose up pitch by a few more degrees and the PIC subsequently responded with increasing nose down pressure. However, the down pressure control input required additional force, so the PIC used trim inputs to reduce the pressure. Moments later he observed an uncommanded aft movement of the control yoke with a simultaneous increase in the airplane's pitch attitude. He instructed the first officer (FO) to retract the flaps while he re-trimmed the elevator, but they were not able to regain pitch control. The FO attempted to adjust his trim wheel and then re-trim the airplane using the emergency varicam, but the airplane continued to maintain a pitch up attitude. He then deployed 5° of flaps at the PIC's instruction, which reduced the elevator backpressure. The PIC subsequently jettisoned the load of fire retardant over vacant farm land and then asked the FO to declare an emergency with the tower controller while the PIC entered a shallow left turn to intercept the downwind leg for runway 21. As he made his control inputs he determined that the elevator was bound, as he received little response from the elevator control. 

As the PIC had previously demonstrated the ability to land without making any adjustments to power or pitch in flight training, he elected to configure the airplane for an approach without trim or elevator control. The flight crew flew a wide traffic pattern and made small adjustments to compensate for altitude. During the final approach leg, the PIC used a combination of wing flaps and engine power for pitch up adjustments, and the crew coordinated application of elevator for trimmed pitch and turns to make their pitch down adjustments. As the airplane reached about 500 feet above ground level, the flight crew deployed the airplane's remaining 5° of flaps to increase the pitch attitude. Both the PIC and FO pulled hard on the yoke while the FO gently retarded the throttles and the PIC trimmed the emergency varicam. 

Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed damage to the varicam. As this secondary control surface is directly connected to the elevators and provides a primary structural load path for all elevator loads, the damage was classified as substantial. Further examination of the varicam showed that one of the varicam actuator's outboard drive stop bolts had backed out of the drive coupling, and that the two bolts had not been safety wired. The airplane did not sustain any damage during the airplane's landing.";20:00;Lockheed P2V-5F Neptune;Neptune Aviation Services;Saturday 5 August 2017

N868FE was cleared to climb to 6000 feet msl after takeoff from Grand Forks. Shortly after takeoff the pilot requested a climb to 8000 feet msl due to icing. The pilot was issued a climb to 7000 feet msl. N868FE then contacted Minneapolis ARTCC and stated to the controller that he was not picking up any more ice at 7000 feet msl and that he was on top of the clouds. The pilot informed the controller that the ice he had picked up was mixed and that it was like wet droplets running back over the wing and freezing. The pilot of N868FE was instructed to contact Bismarck Approach who issued vectors and cleared the pilot for the ILS runway 31 approach. The pilot then contacted the Bismarck Tower and was cleared to land at 08:36. The pilot's acknowledgment was the last radio contact with the flight.

The weather was good with a surface wind from 200° at 13 kt. The aircraft was stabilized but, on short finals at about 150 to 200 ft, the aircraft started to drop, which the pilot described as ""the sensation... of being rapidly pushed down"", or windshear. He tried to pull up to correct the descent but landed heavily in a flat, nose down attitude. The aircraft skidded along the grass runway, veering off to the right and coming to a halt alongside the runway. During the landing, the nose landing gear broke off and the propeller contacted the ground.

All six crew members and 37 of the 40 passengers were killed.
The aircraft was operating as a scheduled flight from Kish Island, Iran to Sharjah, UAE with the captain initially as the pilot flying (PF). 
During the cruise and just prior to descent, the captain unexpectedly handed over control of the aircraft to the First Officer prior to the approach to Sharjah. The first officer did not accept this willingly and stated that he was not confident of his ability to conduct a VOR/DME approach into Sharjah. This statement was not consistent with his previous experience and could indicate either a cultural or professional issue. The captain insisted the first officer fly the aircraft and encouraged and instructed him during the approach. 
At 11:24 hours local time, the aircraft contacted Dubai Arrivals and was cleared from 9000 ft to 5000 ft and instructed to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Sharjah International Airport. At 11:29 hours the aircraft was further cleared to 2500 ft and cleared for the approach. The aircraft was under its own navigation and the daylight conditions were fine with excellent visibility. At 11:35 hours the aircraft was instructed to contact Sharjah Tower and the pilot reported that the aircraft was established on the VOR final approach for runway 12. The Tower cleared IRK7170 to land and advised that the wind was calm. 
At that point the aircraft was slightly above the approach profile. The initial speed for the approach was at least 50 kt high at approximately 190 kt with no flap and no landing gear. The aircraft should have been configured with landing gear down and flap 10° during the approach and stabilized at 130 kt prior to the MDA. Approaching the MDA at flight idle setting, the auto-pilot was disengaged and the first Officer called for flap 10 at 186 kt (limiting speed of 180 kt) and flap 25 was selected by the Captain, a setting uncalled for by the Pilot Flying at 183 kt (limiting speed of 160 kt), and the landing gear was called for and selected at approximately 185 kt (limiting speed of 170 kt). The captain then took control of the aircraft and shortly afterwards the ground range selectors were heard by Cockpit Voice Recorder to be lifted and the power levers moved from the flight idle stop into the ground control range. 
The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range. The aircraft descended in an extreme nose low left bank attitude until impact. The aircraft crashed 2.6 nm from the runway onto an unprepared sandy area adjacent to a road and residential buildings. The aircraft broke apart on impact and a fire started immediately.";11:38;Fokker 50;Kish Air;Tuesday 10 February 2004

The flight was approaching Ciampino Airport's runway 15 about 07:20 local time (05:20 UTC) when the crew encountered problems getting the undercarriage down and locked. A Master Warning occurred and a message was shown on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) display, which indicated ""L/G GEAR NOT DOWNLOCKED"".
The crew flew a missed approach procedure and headed to an area north of Rome were it entered a holding pattern at an altitude of 5000 feet. The crew carried out a recycle and performed a gravity extension as well as some g-force manoeuvres, but the left hand main landing gear remained stuck.
The crew decided to divert to Rome-Fiumicino. 
Approaching Rome-Fiumicino Airport runway 34R at 07:58 (05:58 UTC), the aircraft was instructed by the Tower controller to go-around due to some incoherency in the information provided by the crew about the current position of the landing gear. A new approach to runway 34R was performed and the aircraft touched down on the runway at 08:06 (06:06 UTC) with the left main gear only partially extended. The flightcrew shutoff the left engine just before touchdown and the right one a few seconds later.

The four crew members and thirty passengers were not injured. 
AA334 departed gate Alpha 14 at 06:33, and taxied to ramp spot 22 for de-icing. The aircraft was parked at a northeast direction. The ground de-icing crew notified the flight crew to prepare for de-icing. Approximately ten minutes after de-icing began, the captain reported that he heard and felt a ""thud-like"" noise from outside the aircraft. At the same time, the APU shutdown. One of the de-icing crewmembers on the ground stated he saw a flame come from the APU exhaust and discharged the ground APU fire bottle. Approximately the same time, the #2 flight attendant who was seated in the jumpseat at the rear of the cabin, phoned the captain via the intercom and informed him that the emergency first aid kit sustained damage in the form of a three-inch hole in the back of the kit. The flight attendant stated that an apparent impact on the first aid kit had propelled it from the stowed position into the center aisle of the aircraft. The rear cabin jumpseat was located directly in front of the aft pressure bulkhead. The emergency first aid kit was stowed directly onto the aft wall of the cabin underneath the rear cabin jumpseat.

Two spray trucks were used to de-ice the airplane with Type 1 de-icing fluid. The five-person crew consisted of a checker, a driver for each truck, and a spray bucket operator for each truck. The members of the de-icing crew stated that at the time they were de-icing the airplane, the wind was blowing at 20 knots and gusting. Due to the windy conditions, the drivers of the de-icing trucks had coordinated prior to de-icing the airplane to start at opposite ends of the airplane so the bucket operators would not be spraying each other as they de-iced the airplane. The bucket operators both stated that at times, the wind was whipping the stream of de-icing fluid such that they could not even see the airplane, let alone where the de-icing fluid was being sprayed. Bucket operator #1 stated that he had completed de-icing the nose, right wing, and right horizontal stabilizer of the airplane, and had just started to de-ice the right side of the vertical fin, when he heard a noise and saw that the APU was on fire. Bucket operator #2 stated that he had de-iced the left horizontal stabilizer, the left side of the vertical fin, and aft fuselage, and after the truck was repositioned, he had started to de-ice the left wing when the checker discovered the APU fire. The bucket operators stated that they knew where the F-100's APU air inlet was located, and were aware that de-icing fluid should not be sprayed into the APU inlet. 

The Automated Surface Observing Station for DFW at 0700 reported winds from 320 degrees at 20 knots gusting to 27 knots, visibility 2.5 statute miles in freezing rain and ice pellets, overcast skies at 2,500 feet, temperature minus 4 degrees Celsius, dew point minus six degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.01 inches of Mercury. 

Examination of the airplane revealed APU damage, which was located inside the tailcone. The turbine wheel was found fractured into five pieces. The fracture surfaces were coarse and grainy, with no evidence of fatigue. The impeller was found intact and the impeller vane leading edges had nicks and gouges and were bent opposite the direction of rotation. Ridges on the rear face of the impeller were in line with the vanes on the front face. A fragment of the turbine wheel penetrated the aft pressure bulkhead, and was found embedded in the first aid kit that was stored directly underneath the flight attendant's aft jump seat located at the rear of the cabin. Examination of the APU was conducted at American Airlines' maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The examination revealed two large holes in the APU's compressor case in line with the turbine wheel's plane of rotation. The turbine wheel was broken into several pieces. The broken pieces of the turbine wheel were submitted to Honeywell's Materials Laboratory for a metallurgical examination that confirmed the APU had experienced an overspeed. Further examination did not reveal evidence of fatigue on any of the fracture surfaces. Additionally, the containment ring was broken into three pieces. 

The APU has an electronic control unit (ECU) that meters fuel to the APU while it is in operation. The ECU monitors the rotor speed and will shut off fuel to the APU if it senses an overspeed, which is 107 percent. The ECU was removed from the engine and shipped to Honeywell's Anniston, Alabama facility to interrogate the ECU's non-volatile memory (NVM) and perform a diagnostic test. The NVM indicated that the APU had experienced an overspeed, which is a rotor speed of 107 percent or greater, and had commanded a shutdown. The diagnostic test showed that there were no discrepancies with the ECU.

A review of American Airlines' de-icing training program showed that each of the 5 had completed annual refresher training in de-icing procedures for the F-100. During de-icing training, personnel are advised not to spray the F-100 APU inlet area, and crews are furnished diagrams of each type of airplane that highlight prohibited spray areas.

In February 2001, American Airlines issued a 'Winterization Bulletin' for the F-100 advising that de-ice spray should not be sprayed into the APU inlet. Additionally, the F-100 maintenance manual section 12-31-00, page 301 specifically advises, ""Do not let de-icing and/or anti-icing fluid/water mixture go into the APU inlet. Injury to persons and/or damage to equipment can occur."" American Airlines' policy had been to operate the APU during de-icing. As a result of this event, pilots were instructed to not operate the APU during de-icing operations, and to refer to the operating manual and follow procedures for de-icing with an inoperative APU. De-icing crews were also informed of the change in de-icing procedures, regarding the operation of the APU.

As a result of this event, on March 29, 2002, the National Transportation Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-02-05 that recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) immediately issue an airworthiness directive (AD) for the Fokker F-28 MK-100 and F-28 MK-4000 airplanes that prohibits APU operation during de-icing operations. The FAA issued AD 2001-07-03 that prohibits the operation of the APU during de-icing operations for all series of the F-28 airplane.";07:15;Fokker 100;American Airlines;Wednesday 6 March 2002

Weather at Lubbock was poor with an overcast at 500 feet, freezing drizzle and mist.
The aircraft encountered icing conditions while en route to Lubbock. And although the airplane accumulated some ice during the flight that degraded its performance, the NTSB determined that the aircraft could have landed safely had the airspeed been maintained. 
During the approach to Lubbock runway 17R, at about 1400 feet above the ground and about 90 seconds from the runway, the captain indicated a flight control problem saying, ""We have no flaps."" Although the crewmembers had been trained to perform a go-around and refer to a checklist if a flap problem occurred during an approach, the captain chose to continue the approach as he attempted to troubleshoot the flap anomaly while the first officer flew the plane. Neither flight crewmember adequately monitored the airspeed, which decayed to the extent that the stick shaker activated, which warned of an impending aerodynamic stall. 
The captain continued the unstabilized approach even though he received additional stick shaker activations and an aural ""pull up"" warning from the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). At that point, the plane was descending at a rate of over 2,000 ft per minute. 
Although procedures for responding to either the stick shaker or the TAWS warning require the immediate application of maximum engine power, the captain did not apply maximum power until 17 seconds after the TAWS warning.

The airplane was being operated by Hageland Aviation Services, Inc., as a Ravn Connect cargo/mail flight. The flight originated about 07:58, from the Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow) Airport, Alaska, and it was destined for Atqasuk, which is located about 58 miles south.
The area between Utqiagvik and Atqasuk consists of remote, flat, featureless, tundra-covered terrain, which is snow-covered in April.
Weather conditions at the time of departure consisted of clear skies, 9 miles visibility, and a light wind. After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 2,500 feet msl, and proceeded southbound towards Atqasuk. The pilot said that as the airplane neared Atqasuk, with the autopilot engaged, the airplane descended to about 1,500 feet msl, but then he noticed an area of low fog around Atqasuk. He said that when the airplane was about two miles from the airport, he heard the audible autopilot disengagement annunciator tone sound, which was immediately followed by the pilot's control column pitching forward. The pilot said that he was unable to pull the control column back, and the airplane subsequently descended into instrument meteorological conditions. He said that the airplane continued to descend into the fog, then it struck the snow-covered tundra, and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.

A North Slope Borough Search and Rescue helicopter pilot told the NTSB that while en route from Utqiagvik to the accident site he encountered ice fog, reduced visibility, and flat light conditions that made it difficult to discern topographical features on the snow-covered tundra. He noted that as the flight continued, both pilots noticed ice beginning to accumulate on the helicopter's windscreen, so the decision was made to abort the search and rescue flight, and the helicopter returned to Utqiagvik.

Flight NM309 had departed Leeds/Bradford Airport (LBA), UK on a flight to Ronaldsway Airport (IOM). The flight had been routine and the crew were flying a day, visual approach to runway 26, in good weather, with the surface wind reported as 210° at 14 kt. The commander was the pilot flying (PF) and the co-pilot, who had recently joined the company, was nearing the end of his line training on type. 
The approach was flown with full flap and the gear locked and confirmed down by the three green gear indicators. The landing weight was estimated to be 13,448 lb (6,099 kg) and the crew recalled that the Vref was about 105 kt. 
Almost immediately the aircraft touched down it leaned to the right and there was an unusual noise. The commander levelled the aircraft with a left roll input. 
However, as the speed decayed the lean increased and it became apparent that there was a problem with the right gear. The commander continued to apply left aileron and rudder. Both pilots recognised that the aircraft was likely to leave the paved surface and so the co-pilot held the control wheel and rudder to allow the commander to apply nosewheel steering and operate the feather levers. The left engine was shut down and feathered as the aircraft departed the runway. The right engine was also shut down but its propeller did not feather as the mechanism appears to have been damaged when the blades contacted the runway. The aircraft left the paved surface, yawed to the right and slid sideways before it came to a stop 90° to the runway heading.

The Captain, in the right seat, took over the controls and used the information from the right horizon to continue the flight. The co-pilot noticed that the amber generator lights were on. He tried unsuccessfully to stop and start them. 
The captain decided to abort the flight.
He asked the co-pilot to extend the landing gear. During the extension sequence, the aircraft suffered a total electrical failure. The lighting conditions in the cockpit were then very dark and the crew had difficulty in reading the instrument displays. The captain asked the co-pilot to shine a flashlight on the instruments. He briefly saw the threshold of runway 31R. The co-pilot suggested that he go around as he was unsure that the gear was locked down. During the aerodrome circuit at low height the co-pilot continued extending the landing gear manually. The emergency landing being imminent, the co-pilot stopped doing this, even though he was unsure that the gear was locked down because he didn’t feel enough resistance to indicate that the gear was extended and locked down. Given the weather and the difficulty of reading the instruments, the captain decided to land.

The airplane had been wet-leased by Air France from TAME Ecuador, a commercial division of the Ecuadorian Air Force. The flight crew regularly flew the Bogota-Quito-Bogota route as the final leg of Air France's scheduled flight AF422 from Paris. Air France operated Airbus A340s on the Paris-Bogota leg, but demand on the Quito leg was too weak for use of such a high-capacity transport.
Flight AF422 took off from runway 13 at Bogotá after being cleared for a 'Girardot 1' departure. This departure consist of continuing on runway heading for 2 miles after takeoff, followed by a 90-degree right turn over the 'Romeo' beacon. The flight didn't make the right turn and continued straight ahead.

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was en route to MCI to pick up passengers and continue on as an on-demand charter but diverted to the Kansas City-Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC) following the closure of MCI. MCI was closed due to a McDonnell Douglas MD83 sliding off a taxiway during an after landing taxi on contaminated runway/taxiway conditions. MKC held a limited airport certificate that did not have a snow removal plan and was served by runway 19 (7,002 feet by 150 feet, grooved asphalt). Following a precision approach and landing on runway 19 at MKC, the Learjet 35A slid off the departure end of the runway and impacted airport property and terrain. The Learjet 35A was operated with inoperative thrust reversers as per the airplane's minimum equipment list at the time of the accident. About 1:05 hours before the accident, runway 19 Tapley values were recorded as 21-22-22 with 1/2 inch of wet snow. About 17 minutes before the accident, MKC began snow removal operations. About 7 minutes before the accident, the MKC air traffic control tower (TWR) instructed the snow removal vehicles to clear the runway for inbound traffic. TWR was advised by airport personnel that runway 19 was plowed and surface conditions were 1/4 inch of snow of snow; friction values were not taken or reported. While inbound, the Learjet 35A requested any braking action reports from TWR. The first airplane to land was a Cessna 210 Centurion, and the pilot reported braking action to the TWR as ""moderate"", which was then transmitted by TWR as ""fair"" from a Centurion in response to the Learjet 35A's query.

Purpose of the flight was to carry out flight inspections to confirm the required performance of aeronautical navigation facilities. The captain was Pilot Flying.
While the aircraft was flying south-southwest on Airway V31 toward the Niigata VORTAC at an altitude 9,000 ft, the captain and the first officer sighted a lower layer of clouds but had visually confirmed that there was no cloud on the flight route in the vicinity of Niigata Airport. At about 14:32, the aircraft commenced a descending turn from right above Niigata Airport in order to inspect on the next airway. At this time, the captain and the first officer had checked on an indication on the weather radar display of the aircraft showing a precipitation area, albeit not on their route, and were therefore focusing attention in that direction. They then encountered scattered thin clouds, but this was judged not to be thick clouds which might lead to turbulence or thunder. At about 14:35, as the aircraft entered the thin cloud at an altitude about 6,500 ft, a very loud noise was heard on the radio equipment while the captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer were listening to it. After three to four seconds, the captain and the first officer received an impact accompanied by a loud popping noise, together with a strong flash from the front of the aircraft.
While continuing the flight, the captain and the first officer checked the instruments to check whether abnormality had occurred to the aircraft; consequently, they confirmed that discoloration was found on some of the cockpit instrument displays, and that the airborne DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) display on the captain's side had disappeared. However, there was no abnormality in the DME display on the first officer's side and there was no problem with the visibility of the discolored instrument displays; accordingly, they judged there to be no serious abnormality which would affect the flight.
The captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer discussed whether they should continue the flight inspection, and although there was thought to be no hindrance to the flight, they decided to suspend the flight and return to the base of the aircraft at Tokyo International Airport, because they could not confirm damage to the airframe while on board. Thereafter the aircraft landed at Tokyo International Airport at 15:26. On the post-flight inspection, damage was confirmed to the left front fuselage outer skins, the front lower fuselage and the left horizontal stabilizer.";14:35;Gulfstream G-IV;Japan Civil Aviation Bureau;Friday 13 March 2015

During the initial descent the crew decided to deviate from the planned route because of thunderstorms along their planned route. At 16:19 the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence and thunderstorm activity with extremely heavy precipitation and hail. The crew attempted to fly towards a gap between two storm cells. About 90 seconds after entering the thunderstorm, as the airplane descended through about FL180 at a flight idle power setting, both engines flamed out. The crew carried out three unsuccessful attempts to restart the engines followed by one unsuccessful attempt to start the auxiliary power unit (APU). The flight crew’s reported actions to restart the engines and APU however, were contrary to the procedures contained in the Boeing 737 Operations Manual. For instance, they waited only about 1 minute between each restart attempt instead of three minutes. 
As the airplane descended below an overcast cloud layer at about 8,000 feet, the crew observed the Bengawan Solo River and decided to attempt to ditch the airplane into the river with flaps and landing gear in a shallow, 1 metre deep part of the river. One stewardess did not survive the crash.

The first segment of the flight from Lagos (LOS) to Abuja (ABV) was flown by the Commander. The aircraft departed Lagos about 06:30 hours UTC and initially at cruise, the crew had a momentary problem setting power on the starboard engine after which the flight continued normally to Abuja. 
The aircraft which departed Abuja for Jos (JOS) at 09:00 hours UTC first officer at the controls. At FL 90 and about 30NM from Abuja, the crew again had problems with the cruise power setting on the starboard engine. The torque remained at 1400. The crew retarded the right power lever to the minimum with the aim of achieving a cruise setting of 1300 but the gear warning came on. The Commander at this stage took over the controls from the first officer. At 09:23 hours UTC, the aircraft contacted Kaduna Tower that it would be diverting to Kaduna (KAD) giving its flight level as 90 at a distance of 61 miles and estimating TMA at 24 miles, 'KC' at 41 miles, 6 souls on board and 5 hours endurance at departure. The tower then gave the aircraft an inbound clearance to 'KC' locator maintaining FL 90 and to expect no delay for a locator approach runway 05. Weather report at 09:00 hours UTC was also passed to the aircraft as wind 090/05 knots, QNH 1014 and temperature 30°C. At 09:28 hours UTC the airplane at about 42 miles, speed between 150-160 kts, requested descent and was cleared to 4,500ft, QNH 1014. At about 09:35 hours UTC, the pilots contacted tower that they would make a single engine approach because they were having problems controlling power on the starboard engine and it would be shut down. 
The commander then reviewed the single engine approach with the first officer estimating 4,500 ft at 8NM. Approaching 4,500 ft at 11 NM, the crew initiated right engine shut down after which the speed was decayed from 150 to 140 kts. At 09:46 hours UTC, the pilot reported 6nm final and field in sight while the tower requested him to report 4 miles final. The controller reported having the aircraft in sight and subsequently cleared it to land on runway 05 giving wind as north easterly 06 knots. Descending at 500ft/min, the commander requested for 25% of flap when the first officer selected full flap. When the aircraft was at 2,700 ft high, the speed had already decayed to between 100 - 110 kts. The crew applied full power on the port engine to arrest the speed decay but to no avail. The pilot was trying to correct the descent rate, speed decay and the asymmetry when the stall warning came on.

The aircraft was cleared for a runway 07 ILS approach, but the approach was abandoned due to indications that the undercarriage was not down and locked. The flight crew concluded that all gear were down and locked despite a red GEAR light on the forward instrument panel. The crew had failed to recognize that the green GEAR DOWN light for the nose gear was not illuminated and assumed that the red GEAR light on the forward instrument panel was a false indication. The gear was recycled, but an alternate extension was not attempted.
The pilot positioned the airplane for another approach. The aircraft touched down with the nose gear retracted. The nose struck the runway.

The pilot responded to that clearance, but according to the radar data, the airplane started a slow right turn. 
About 45 seconds after the last radio contact, the departure controller advised the pilot that he had lost radar contact. There was no response from the pilot to that transmission. The airplane impacted the ground in a construction yard near the north edge of a cinderblock building. The impact was followed by an extensive fire.

The flight originated from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at 12:55. 
The flight crew was in cruise flight when a master caution light illuminated indicating a loss of the right hydraulic system pressure and hydraulic fluid. The crew used the checklist to trouble shoot the system and attempted to manually extend the main and nose landing gear (NLG) using the alternate extension control lever. Both main gear extended and locked into place; however the NLG did not extend. The airplane was landed with the NLG in the retracted position. Initial inspection of the airplane revealed that a B-nut to the check valve on the rudder power hydraulic shut off valve, was separated from the valve resulting in a total loss of right hydraulic quantity and pressure. Examination of the hydraulic tube, including the B-nut and check valve, did not reveal any abnormalities. Examination of the cockpit revealed the landing gear handle was in the stowed position.

All four on board were killed.
Before departure from Shoreham Airport, U.K, the pilot had called the destination airport, Trier-Föhren. He was told it would be better to postpone the departure because of thick fog. The departure was not postponed and the Citation jet took off from Shoreham about 10:00 hours. Alternate airfields were Luxembourg and Frankfurt-Hahn. Given the weather conditions the owner of the aircraft expected a diversion, and according to family members did not but pressure on the pilots to land at Trier.
The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. At 11:45, while descending from FL90 to 5000 feet, the pilot in command contacted air traffic control to cancel their IFR clearance. The controller confirmed this and reported that they were 15 miles northwest of their destination airfield.
The airplane was approaching runway 22 and descended until it was flying at a very low altitude, clearing trees by some 15-20 meters, according to eyewitnesses. It pulled up and struck an electricity pylon at a height of about 8 m above the ground. Control was lost and the airplane rolled inverted and crashed. It came to rest inverted on the site of a landfill, located 3,8 km from the threshold of runway 22 and about 700 m to the left of the extended centreline. A fire erupted.

The continued descent to the ground likely occurred due to an erroneous selection of the target altitude with 0 ft (sea level) instead of the real aerodrome elevation (666 ft AMSL). Good Crew Resource Management could have brought this error to light but the different personality traits of the two pilots and particularly the captain’s low appreciation of the co-pilot probably negatively
influenced the working relationship in regards to CRM principles.

The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway centerline with the left hand main gear off the paved runway surface. It ran onto soft soil and the nose landing gear collapsed.

The aircraft touched down at to the left of the centerline because the FMGS NAV database contained threshold coordinates for a proposed displacement of the runway 02 threshold. This was later withdrawn through a NOTAM, but had not been updated by the airline in the FMGS. Additionally, the coordinates that were initially published were inaccurate, causing the threshold coordinates to be offset to the left of the actual threshold.

On February 23, 2017, the aircraft was due to operate a return flight from Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM) to Belfast City Airport, Northern Ireland. The scheduled departure time was 07:15 UTC and the return flight was scheduled to arrive back at IOM at 08:50.
Overnight and into the morning of the 23 February, Storm Doris underwent explosive cyclogenesis. The centre of the storm moved rapidly through Northern Ireland in the early hours, across northern England and out into the North Sea by the early afternoon.
Strong winds were forecast for the area. The surface wind at Belfast, where runways 04 and 22 were available, was reported at 06:20 to be from 230° at 9 kt but, because they received no TAF for this destination, the pilots selected two alternate airports; Belfast International Airport and IOM.
The latest weather information at IOM showed a wind from 230° at 32 kt gusting to 45 kt, creating a maximum crosswind component of 22 kt. The relevant maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the Let L-410 is 19.4 kt and this was included in the ‘Performance Limitations’ section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) but the aircraft operator did not apply a limiting component of crosswind to its operations. The only wind limit that was applied and used by the crew was 45 kt for ground operation.
When the wind changed to 260° at 39, gusting to 55 kt, the flight was delayed because this exceeded the ground operation limit,

Departure
At 07:50 the crew learnt the wind was from 290° at 31 G 40 kt and as both these more recent reports were within the ground operation limit, they decided to depart, with 550 kg of fuel on board. 
Three passengers boarded and the aircraft taxied at 08:10. Shortly afterwards, at the request of Belfast City ATC, the crew were informed that the wind was from 320° at 31 G 46 kt, and IOM ATC asked the crew for their intentions because Belfast City ATC had reported no other known aircraft movements. The crew elected to continue the flight and took off on runway 26 at 08:23 hrs, when the reported wind was from 290° at 21 G 41 kt. The co-pilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF).
No difficulties were encountered en route to Belfast.
When the PNF contacted Belfast City ATC, he was told radar vectoring was available for an ILS approach to runway 04 and that the wind was now from 320° at 28 G 43 kt. The PNF informed ATC they would make one approach but would go around if the approach was not stable.
The crew reported afterwards that they experienced continuous moderate turbulence during the latter part of the approach. The final wind check, given after they had been cleared to land, was from 320° at 35 kt. They judged that the aircraft operator’s stable approach criteria were met until the aircraft passed over the runway threshold, when turbulence de-stabilised the aircraft and they initiated a go-around.
ATC reported that the aircraft went around from approximately 20 ft above the runway at 08:58 hrs and climbed straight ahead to 3,000 ft amsl, the standard missed approach procedure. The aircraft continued heading northeast until 09:01 hrs when the PNF informed ATC they would not make a second approach and would return to IOM.

Return
Once level at FL070, the PNF listened to the ATIS for the IOM, which stated runway 26 was in use, it was wet, and detailed the 0850 METAR, which noted that the wind was from 290° at 28 kt. The PF briefed for an approach with the flaps set to 18°, and a target VREF of 105 kt; with a ""slightly right crosswind"". After the brief was completed he commented on the intercom that the wind was ""not so challenging"" at IOM but shortly after this ATC provided a special weather observation, timed at 09:12 hrs, which stated the wind was now from 310° at 41 kt and gusting between 22 and 53 kt. When asked by ATC if they wished to make an approach, the PNF replied ""of course"". The crew accepted radar vectoring for an ILS approach to runway 26, with the co-pilot remaining as PF. Before the aircraft was directed towards its final approach, ATC reported the wind was from 310° at 43 kt but gusting between 23 and 63 kt.
At 09:24, after the aircraft had become established on the ILS centreline and glideslope, ATC radioed clearance to land, with a reported wind of 300° at 41 kt but gusting between 31 and 63 kt. While receiving this message, the crew were also presented with an aural ""glideslope"" caution and immediately after this the PF declared ""1,000 ft stabilised"". While the PNF was adjusting the propeller rpm, another aural ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF immediately stated ""correcting"". Following an automatically generated message stating the aircraft was at 500 ft agl, one further ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF responded saying ""correcting, runway in sight"".
The final wind check provided by ATC, approximately 35 seconds before the aircraft touched down, was from 300° at 48 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt. 

Landing
Given the environmental conditions, ATC was concerned for the safety of the aircraft and its occupants when it landed, so the airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) had been placed on alert with two vehicles facing towards the runway, approximately 200 m from the touchdown zone. During the aircraft’s approach, ATC discussed the situation with the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration because another of the same operator’s aircraft had been blown onto its wingtip while taxiing in 2007, in winds greater than 45 kt, and both parties knew 45 kt was now the operator’s maximum ground operation limit.
As the aircraft crossed the threshold it seemed unstable and it rolled considerably, causing the tip of the left wing (the downwind wing) to tilt down until it seemed in close proximity to the runway, before the wheels made first contact. The aircraft then bounced and rolled left again before touching down for a second time, on all three wheels.
After travelling along the runway for approximately 20 m, the right mainwheel was seen to lift off the ground and nearby RFFS witnesses estimated the left wingtip rolled to within one metre of the runway surface. The crew seemed aware of this roll because, approximately nine seconds after touchdown, the PF stated ""ailerons...good...too much roll"". 
After landing the commander took control and the co-pilot commented ""taxi carefully with the wind"". ATC then stated the surface wind was from 300° at 47 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt and asked if they wished to taxi or to hold on the runway. The crew replied ""we will try and taxi and if we can make it we will vacate, otherwise we need to leave the aircraft here"". The crew then accepted taxi instructions directing them towards the terminal but, 45 seconds later, as the aircraft was leaving the runway, ATC radioed to the crew, ""direction from Isle of Man CAA, hold position."" The aircraft stopped facing into the wind. Both ATC and the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration later indicated that they were concerned that if the aircraft continued to taxi with the wind gusting to 63 kt an accident could occur. 
RFFS vehicles were positioned around the aircraft, to provide some screening from the wind, and a bus transferred the three uninjured passengers to the terminal building. The aircraft was later tied down until the wind subsided.";09:27 UTC;Let L-410UVP-E;null;Thursday 23 February 2017

All three crew members were killed.
The Saras airplane was scheduled for carrying out test flight no 49, which would include inflight engine shut down and relight procedure at 10000 feet AMSL. 
The aircraft took-off from Bangalore-Hindustan Airport (BLR) at 14:55. The flight was cleared to flight level 100. After completing general handling checks at 9000’AMSL without any events, a single engine simulated approach was carried out on runway 09. At about 15:11 the crew were cleared to perform an overshoot. 
The crew contacted the Bangalore Radar controller, who cleared them back to FL100 and proceed to sector Southwest 2 for carrying out the engine relight test procedure. The crew reported reaching 9000’AMSL in sector Southwest at about 15:18. 
The no. 1 engine was then shut down and secured following the test procedure at about 15:31. After about 47 seconds, the no. 1 engine relight procedure was initiated at around 9200’AMSL.
After a successful left engine shut down and its securing procedure, at about 15:31 left engine relight procedure was initiated at about 9200’AMSL. The propeller blade pitch was selected from feathered to fine. This led to an increased in propeller rpm from 5 to 55%. Side slip increased up to 28 degrees and bank angle changed from 8 deg right to 70 degrees left. The pitch attitude was seen reaching -42 degrees. Propeller rpm continued to increase to 91%. Then the aircraft went into a sudden dive from 9200’ to 7300’ for about 13 secs. The aircraft was brought under control at this altitude. The crew continued their attempt to relight the engine but this was not successful. Meanwhile the side slip remained at 22 degrees with a pitch attitude of about -15 deg. The speed remained at 130 kt and altitude reduced from 7000 feet to 5200 feet.
A second relight attempt was successful but the airplane was still in a rapid descent passing 4800 feet. Rudder pedal forces
increased to as high as 90 kg with aileron forces raising to 40 kg. The crew were not able to fully control the airplane and arrest the descent. It impacted the ground.

Flight PE905 departed Grande Prairie (CYQU) at 10:40 MST on the first leg of a scheduled run to Fort St. John (CYXJ), Fort Nelson, BC, and Grande Prairie. 
Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to maintain 12 000 feet above sea level (asl), and to hold on the TAYLOR non directional beacon (NDB), which forms the final approach fix for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 29 at St. John. At 11:09, Flight PE905 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 29. The first approach was discontinued due to the aircraft being too high on the final approach leg, and clearance was given to return to the TAYLOR NDB at 6000 feet. At 11:23, ATC cleared the flight for another ILS approach to runway 29. The second approach was conducted as a full procedure with the outbound leg extended to ensure that the aircraft was positioned to follow the correct vertical approach profile.
The final approach course was flown with a flap setting of 20º and at the company standard operating procedure (SOP) recommended airspeed of 130 knots. At approximately 300 feet above ground level, the first officer informed the captain that he had the ground in sight. The approach lights were visual shortly thereafter. The captain discontinued his instrument scan and confirmed the appearance of the approach lights. The captain made the decision to land, and called for the full flap setting of 35º. The first officer diverted his attention to setting flaps, and to the Vref reference cards clipped to the instrument panel. When he looked up, the aircraft was almost on the ground, but short of the runway. There was insufficient time to warn the captain.
The aircraft initially touched down in a nearly wings-level attitude, 320 feet short of the threshold in about 16 inches of packed snow. The left main gear contacted the surface first, followed by the right main gear, and then the nose wheel. The aircraft then struck the last set of approach lights, bounced slightly, and touched down again 180 feet short of the threshold. After sliding through the threshold lights, the aircraft came to rest on the right edge of the runway, 380 feet beyond the threshold.

The flight crew considered the wind speed and direction and decided to follow the same practice as the previous day and scoop water from Moosehead Lake.
After takeoff, the PNF was required to complete the ""After Takeoff"" checklist, and in preparation for scooping water, to complete the ""Water Bombing in Range"" and ""Pick-up"" checklists.
About 4 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft touched down about 1250 feet from the eastern shore of the lake, on a heading of 250°. The PF then applied takeoff power, and the PNF began adjusting the torque limit stops. Throughout the scooping run, the PNF was focused on ensuring that the soft stops were set as per the PF's instructions.
While adjusting the soft stops, the PNF noted that the water tanks were completely full, and advised the PF that the probes were still down and the PROBE AUTO/MANUAL switch was in the MANUAL selection. The PNF then manually selected the probes up. The probes retracted about 3490 feet after touchdown.
The flight crew continued the takeoff despite indication by the water status display panel that water quantity was in excess of that allowable for this takeoff.
At the time the probes were retracted, the aircraft was about 2500 feet from the departure-end shoreline of the lake. The PF determined that the aircraft would require a greater distance to become airborne and initiated a left turn to follow the lake. About 2 seconds later, the aircraft’s hull began to lift out of the water, and the left float contacted the water.
For the next 4 seconds, aileron and rudder control surface deflections commanded a left turn; however, during this time, the aircraft was skidding to the outside of the turn. The float remained in contact with the water, and the aircraft‘s hull was completely out of the water. The PF deflected the elevators up to near full deflection, with no corresponding response in pitch attitude, and then initiated a right turn using ailerons, with no response to this input.
About a second later, the aircraft’s hull was about 7 feet above the water, with the float still in contact with the water. The float separated from its pylon, resulting in a sudden pitch-down moment.
The forward section of the hull collided with the water, causing the lower part of the forward fuselage to tear open. The right wing float collided with the water, causing complete separation of the right float and pylon. The aircraft came to rest upright, with the cockpit partially underwater. The flight crew briefly delayed their evacuation until the propellers had stopped rotating.

The PNF retrieved a life vest and evacuated the aircraft through the overhead escape hatch. Once on top of the aircraft, the PNF donned the life vest. The PF could not retrieve a life vest and exited the aircraft through the left-side sliding window.
The flight crew remained on the wing as the aircraft continued to sink. The PNF contacted company personnel by cellular telephone and advised them of the situation. Within about 30 minutes, Department of Natural Resources employees arrived by boat and transported the flight crew to shore.
The aircraft settled on the lake bottom, about 225 feet from the southern shore of the lake.

The aircraft had taken-off from Lokichoggio, Kenya at 11:03 hours for a flight destined for Yida, South Sudan. While at 16,000 feet, approximately 100 miles from Yida, the no. 2 engine reportedly ceased. A restart was attempted and this was successful, but shortly after, the engine ceased again.
The crew then opted to proceed to Yida on one engine while monitoring their descent rate. The rest of the flight was uneventful until touchdown at Yida. Shortly after commencing their landing roll, the crew heard a thud. The aircraft assumed a nose down attitude. Shortly thereafter, the nose gear collapsed. The aircraft was still rolling down the runway, with dust and other debris entering the cockpit from the damaged nose gear section.

On board were one pilot and five passengers. The pilot received fatal injuries in the accident; the passengers mostly suffered serious injuries. Weather conditions at the time were good, but it was after nightfall; the moon had not risen and there was little cultural lighting in the area.
The aircraft crashed into a shallow lagoon approximately one nautical mile south-east of North Caicos Airport. Wreckage was spread along a trail that extended in excess of 370 m along a track of 220°(M). The aircraft's fuselage had come to rest comparatively intact, although lying in an inverted attitude. Evidence from the accident site indicated that the aircraft had struck the water in a nominally upright attitude, with only a moderate rate of descent but at relatively high forward speed.
From a detailed examination of the wreckage and the circumstances of the accident, it was concluded that the aircraft was structurally intact and probably under control when it struck the surface. The evidence indicated that each engine was producing power throughout the short flight and at the time of impact. Although anomalies were found which suggested that a possible power asymmetry may have existed, this should not have been sufficient to cause the pilot serious control difficulties.
None of the passengers described an obvious problem with the aircraft during the flight, and most remained unaware of the impending crash. The circumstances of the accident suggested that the pilot became spatially disorientated, to the extent that the aircraft diverged from its intended flight path and reached an irrecoverable situation. The environmental conditions were conducive to a disorientation event, and a postmortem toxicological examination showed that the pilot had a level of blood alcohol which, although below the prescribed limit, was significant in terms of piloting an aircraft and would have made him more prone to disorientation.
The evidence indicated that the pilot had probably started a recovery to normal flight, but too late to prevent the accident. However, his actions had the effect of reducing the descent rate and placing the aircraft in a nearly level attitude at impact. This lessened the impact damage and helped preserve the fuselage structure relatively intact, increasing the passengers' chance of survival.";18:42;Beechcraft 200C Super King Air;Air Turks & Caicos (2003);Tuesday 6 February 2007

The airplane was being operated as an instrument (IFR) cross-country cargo flight. The crew of the airplane, consisting of the captain, first officer, flight engineer, and a load master, were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan was filed. The flight originated at the Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, Alaska, about 08:00.

The director of operations for the operator reported to the NTSB that the Lake Minchumina Airport has a gravel runway that is oriented on a 020/200 degree heading. He added that the captain flew over the airport to inspect the runway conditions, and subsequently elected to use runway 20. He said that the runway is 4,200 feet long, 90 feet wide, and that the gravel runway had a number of frost-heaves that have developed during the past winter. On initial touchdown the airplane ""skipped"" as the main wheels touched down on the crest of one of the frost-heaves. The airplane became airborne, floated slightly, and then touched down about 750 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. During the second landing flare, the main landing gear wheels touched on the downhill side of a second frost-heave, which allowed the tail of the airplane to contact the gravel runway. The captain characterized the second touchdown as within acceptable limits, but with a slightly nose high attitude. After touchdown, the captain lowered the nose of the airplane, brought the engines into reverse, and completed the landing. After landing rollout, the airplane was taxied to parking. A postflight inspection by the crew discovered a 4 feet by 2 feet puncture on the belly of the airplane, just forward of the main cargo door.";08:50;Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules;Lynden Air Cargo;Monday 2 July 2001

The airplane was operated by Swiftair under an ACMI arrangement with Gryphon Airlines. 
Flight SWT094 departed Dubai Airport (DXB) at 06:08 local time on a scheduled service to Kandahar with the first officer as pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Kandahar approach cleared them for an RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 05, providing a direct vector to the FALOD Initial Approach Fix and to descend to 6000 ft.
Runway in use was runway 05, and wind was reported from 060° at 17 kt gusting to 24 kt, visibility 1200 m, scattered clouds at 2700 ft and broken clouds at 3000 ft, temperature 1°C, dewpoint -7°C and QNH 1018 mbar. 
The target speed associated with a landing weight of 136,000 lb was estimated at 140 KIAS (Vref 135 +5). At a radio altitude of 1000 feet the airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps 40 and landing gear down. The heading was within margins but the speed was 192 kts. It should have been between Vref (135 knots) and Vref+20 (155 knots). Also, the airplane was above the theoretical glide slope. It was also descending at a rate well in excess of 1000 ft/min. The approach was not stabilized at this point.
Since the captain had more operational experience at the Kandahar, he decided to take over the controls and fly the last phase of the approach. The PAPI was out of service, meaning they only had visual references to the runway and above the ground during the final part of the approach.
During short final the captain corrected a deviation from the runway centerline by adjusting the flight path from right to left. During the flare, the crew noticed the airplane was shifting to the left, threatening to take them off the runway, as a result of which the captain applied a +20° right bank angle at a +9° pitch angle. This caused the right wing tip to strike the ground before the wheels made contact with the ground.
Touchdown speed was 122 knots, which was below Vref as well as the target speed .
The captain regarded the maneuver as a hard landing, although the first officer thought they might have struck the runway. On exiting the runway, the airport control tower ordered the crew to stop and informed them of the damage they experienced.
The wing had contacted the ground some 20 m prior to the threshold, resulting in five threshold lights being destroyed by the aircraft.";08:28;McDonnell Douglas DC-9-83 (MD-83);null;Tuesday 24 January 2012

The total freight on board was 14,000 lb (6350 kg), less than half the 33,000 lb (14970 kg) maximum amount permissible. Shannon Approach vectored the aircraft on an approach to runway 24. Due to the weather forecast for Shannon the crew decided to conduct the landing with 78% flaps set, rather than the standard 100% flap normally set for landing. Slowing the aircraft to Vma (Maximum Manoeuvering Airspeed) the crew did not carry out the ""before landing"" checks. Whilst over the runway threshold the gear warning horn sounded and five seconds later the crew heard a scraping sound and felt severe aircraft vibrations. Realising that the gear was not down the captain called for a go-around. The First Officer continued to fly the aircraft and was cleared to 3000 feet by ATC. During the climb out the propeller assembly and part of No. 3 engine fell to the ground. Electrical power was lost and the only serviceable flight instruments available to the crew was the standby artificial horizon and wet compass. The First Officer relinquished control of the aircraft to the captain who had great difficulty in maintaining directional control and it took the combined efforts of both pilots
to control the excessive yaw through the rudder pedals. In addition, there was insufficient power available to climb to 3000 feet. In fact, less than 2000 feet was
attained, as the aircraft commenced a slow difficult turn in a North Easterly direction and towards the high ground west of Limerick city. It was only by further manipulation of the throttles and feathering No. 4 engine that sufficient directional control was recovered. The aircraft was now flying with only no. 1 engine fully operative and No. 2 engine producing only half power and much vibration. The Radar operator vectored the aircraft again to approach runway 24. They selected ""gear down"" and while only 2 of the 3 green landing lights illuminated, the captain elected to proceed with the landing, with the flaps again set at 78%.

There were 10 passengers and two crew members on board. Both crew members and four passengers were killed. 
The airplane operated on Manx2 flight NM7100 from Belfast City Airport (BHD) to Cork Airport (ORK). Following a fuel uplift a total fuel quantity of 3000 lb (1360 kg) was recorded, which was sufficient for the planned round trip to Cork and back to Belfast. The flight plan specified Waterford Airport (EIWF) as the alternate for the sector to Cork.
The accident flight took off from Belfast at 08:10 hrs, and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 120. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF) with the commander acting as Pilot Non Flying (PNF). 
At 08:48 the flight contacted Cork Approach Control. The Cork ATIS information stated that runway 35 was the active runway with Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) in operation. Cork Approach also informed the flight crew that runway 35 was the active runway with CAT II available for runway 17. The RVRs on runway 17 were passed by Cork Approach as 300 m (touchdown), 350 m (midpoint) and 550 m (stop-end) (300/350/550). Flight 7100 was given the choice of runways, and while runway 35 was initially considered by the flight crew, a decision was made to opt for an approach to runway 17. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who stated ""...that’s copied, just check IRVRs Runway 17 for CAT II, currently at 350, 350, and 450."" 
The aircraft first established on the ILS approach to runway 17 at 08:58 and was handed over to Cork Tower. The RVRs passed by Cork Tower at 09:00 hrs were 300/400/375. The approach was continued beyond the 3.5 nautical miles (nm) DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:03 hrs, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 101 ft radio altitude.
A second ILS approach was then flown, to the reciprocal direction runway 35, with the aircraft being handed over to Cork Tower at 09.10 at 8 nm from touchdown. At 09:10:56 the flight crew reported established on the ILS runway 35. The RVRs passed by the Tower at this time were 350/350/350. Descent was continued beyond the 4.9 nm DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:14, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 91 ft radio altitude.
At 09:15 hrs the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern for 15 to 20 minutes to see if the weather would improve. The flight took up the holding pattern at point ROVAL maintaining an altitude of 3,000 ft. The flight crew requested the weather for Waterford. This weather, which was below minima, was provided by Cork Approach. The flight crew nominated Shannon Airport as their second alternate and requested weather information. Shannon weather was passed by Cork Approach, it was below minima. Weather for Dublin Airport was then sought by the flight crew. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who offered to provide the weather for Kerry Airport also. The weather at Kerry was passed with the visibility being reported as greater than 10 kilometres. Weather conditions at Dublin, which were marginal, were obtained and passed to the flight crew at 09:35 hrs.
At approximately 09:32 hrs, with EC-ITP still in the ROVAL hold, the RVR values on runway 17 at Cork began to improve. Following a further improvement to 500/450/400 at 09:39 hrs, the flight crew elected to attempt another approach to runway 17. 
At 09:45 the aircraft reported established on the ILS, and was configured with landing gear down and 1/2 flaps selected. At 09:45:26, when EC-ITP was at 11 nm DME on the ILS, the RVR (touchdown) improved to 550 m, which was passed to the flight crew by Cork Approach.
At 09:45:38, the flight was handed over to the Cork Tower and the flight crew reported to the Tower at 09:46:00 passing 9 nm DME. The final RVRs passed to EC-ITP at 09.46:15 were 500/400/400 when the aircraft was 9.6 nm from the threshold of runway 17. At approximately 400 ft radio altitude, recorded data shows the aircraft deviated to the right of the runway centreline, paralleling the centreline track.
The descent was continued below Decision Height (DH). Power was reduced momentarily before being re-applied. Just below 100 ft radio altitude, a go-around was called by the PNF and was acknowledged by the PF. 
Recorded data shows that the aircraft rolled significantly to the left as the aircraft tracked towards the runway centreline. This was immediately followed by a rapid roll to the right which brought the right wingtip into contact with the runway surface. Runway surface contact was made with a roll angle of 97 degrees to the right. The initial impact mark was located 86 m from the runway threshold, and 2 m left of the centreline. 
The aircraft continued to roll rapidly to the right and struck the runway in the fully inverted position 25 m beyond the initial impact point. The inverted aircraft departed the runway surface on a heading of approximately 195° M and came to a rest 189 m from the initial impact point. The propeller blades on both engines were severely damaged; three of the four propeller blades on the right-hand engine detached during the inverted impact. Fire occurred in both engines post impact. 

The AOC of the operator contained approval for the aircraft to operate CAT I approaches only. In this case a decision height of 200 feet at an RVR (touchdown) minimum of 550 m for runway 17 and 750 m for runway 35.";09:50;Swearingen SA227-BC Metro III;null;Thursday 10 February 2011

Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing.

Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position.

Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer. The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet. However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway. The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt.

The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplane’s loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow. At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it.";13:45;Learjet 60;Ark-Air Flight Inc.;Sunday 14 January 2001

The payload comprised 1790 kilograms (kg) of courier packs and parcel mail. Loading of the freight was delayed, being completed at about 21:15. The crew ordered 570 litres (about 1000 pounds or 450 kg) of additional fuel and instructed the refueller to put it all into the left wing tank, rather than put half of the ordered amount into
each tank, as was company practice. Refuelling was completed at 21:30. Two minutes later the flight taxied out to runway 23R. Takeoff was performed at 21:36. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of FL220 with the autopilot engaged for the climb and cruise. At cruise altitude the climb power remained set for about 15 minutes in order to make up some of the delay caused by the late departure. At about 22:12:28, after power was reduced to a cruise setting and the cruise checks had been completed, the captain noted some fuel imbalance and decided to carry out further fuel balancing. He said, ""We’ll just open the crossflow again ..sit on left ball and trim it accordingly"". The captain repeated the instruction 5 times in a period of 19 seconds, by telling the first officer to, ""Step on the left pedal, and just trim it to take the pressure off"" and ""Get the ball out to the right as far as you can ..and just trim it"". The first officer sought confirmation of the procedure and said, ""I was being a bit cautious"" to which the captain replied, ""Don’t be cautious mate, it’ll do it good"".
These instructions resulted in the aircraft being flown at a large sideslip angle by the use of the rudder trim control while the autopilot was engaged. Forty-seven seconds after opening the crossflow, the captain said, ""Doesn’t like that one mate.. you’d better grab it."" Within one second there was the aural alert ""Bank angle"", followed by a chime tone, probably the selected altitude deviation warning. Both pilots exclaimed surprise.
The autopilot had probably disengaged automatically because a servo reached its torque limit, allowing the aircraft to roll and dive abruptly as a result of the applied rudder trim. The crew was unable to recover control from the ensuing spiral dive before airspeed and g limits were grossly exceeded, resulting in the structural failure and in-flight break-up of the aircraft. The flying conditions of a dark night with cloud cover below probably made it more difficult to notice the developing upset at an early stage.
The break-up probably started when the aircraft was quite high, perhaps FL199. The wreckage was scattered over a large area of at least two to three sq km of rural farmland.";22:14;Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III;Airwork, NZ;Monday 2 May 2005

The copilot was fatally injured; the captain and the passenger received serious injuries.
The flight originated from the Tucson International Airport (TUS), Arizona, at 10:04 and was bound for Aspen.
The departure and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. As the flight neared its destination, a high-altitude, terrain-limited airport, air traffic control (ATC) provided vectors to the localizer/distance measuring equipment (LOC/DME)-E approach to runway 15. About 12:10, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 290º at 19 knots (kts) with gusts to 25 kts. About 12:11, the flight crew reported that they were executing a missed approach and then requested vectors for a second approach. ATC vectored the airplane for a second LOC/DME-E approach to runway 15. About 12:21, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 330° at 16 kts and the 1-minute average wind was from 320° at 14 kts gusting to 25 kts.
The initial part of the airplane's second approach was as-expected for descent angle, flap setting, and spoilers. During the final minute of flight, the engines were advanced and retarded five times, and the airplane's airspeed varied between 135 kts and 150 kts. The final portion of the approach to the runway was not consistent with a stabilized approach. The airplane stayed nose down during its final descent and initial contact with the runway. The vertical acceleration and pitch parameters were consistent with the airplane pitch oscillating above the runway for a number of seconds before a hard runway contact, a gain in altitude, and a final impact into the runway at about 6 g.
The weather at the time of the accident was near or in exceedance of the airplane's maximum tailwind and crosswind components for landing, as published in the airplane flight manual.
Given the location of the airplane over the runway when the approach became unstabilized and terrain limitations of Aspen, performance calculations were completed to determine if the airplane could successfully perform a go-around. Assuming the crew had control of the airplane, and that the engines were advanced to the appropriate climb setting, anti-ice was off, and tailwinds were less than a sustained 25 kts, the airplane had the capability to complete a go-around, clearing the local obstacles along that path.
Both flight crewmembers had recently completed simulator training for a type rating in the CL-600 airplane. The captain reported that he had a total of 12 to 14 hours of total flight time in the airplane type, including the time he trained in the simulator. The copilot would have had close to the same hours as the captain given that they attended flight training together. Neither flight crew member would have met the minimum flight time requirement of 25 hours to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135. The accident flight was conducted under Part 91, and therefore, the 25 hours requirement did not apply to this portion of their trip. Nevertheless, the additional flight time would have increased the crew's familiarity with the airplane and its limitation and likely improved their decision-making during the unstabilized approach.";12:22;Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 601-3R;Vineland Corporation;Sunday 5 January 2014

The airplane was substantially damaged. The flight originated about 16:12, from the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport.
While flying in precipitation deviating within 10 miles from the edge of a level 5 thunderstorm associated with a squall line, the airplane was struck by lightning. Arching damage to the No. 1 elevator pressure and No. 2 elevator return hydraulic lines resulted in depletion of the hydraulic fluid from the Nos. 1 and 2 hydraulic system reservoirs. 
The airplane was landed on a wet runway and after touchdown, 2 of the 4 main landing gear tires ruptured. The airplane traveled off the left side of the runway, across grass, and came to rest with the nose landing gear separated. A loose canon plug at the parking brake shutoff valve was discovered which prevented the operation of the alternate antiskid system. That area was inspected 2 days earlier. The airplane was only equipped by design with 1 bonding strap located on the left side of the airplane for the horizontal and vertical stabilizer; which failed. 
An Advisory Circular recommends that the area be designated for carrying substantial amounts of electrical current, but the airplane was not designed for such.

Upon departure from Surgut, the weather at Samara was below minima with a visibility of 200 m in fog. An improvement was expected to a visibility of 3000 m upon arrival.
The Tupolev 134 took off at 04:08 UTC, climbing to the cruising altitude of 10600 m. En route weather reports showed an improvement to a visibility of 1500 m at Samara. 
At 06:18 UTC (11:18 local time), shortly after contacting Samara Control, the captain briefed the crew about the arrival procedures for Samara. During the briefing he incorrectly stated that the altitude at which they would capture the glide slope was 500 m (the actual height is 400 m according to the approach charts). About 06:22, Samara Control cleared the flight to descend to 5400 m. During their descent, about 06:30, the ground wind at Samara Airport changed direction from west (270-290°) to southeast (120°) with fog again worsening the visibility.
Samara Approach cleared the flight further down to 2400 m and reported of 1200 m with haze and fog. At 06:35 the crew received further clearances in preparation for an approach to runway 23 and the controller reported pressure at the airfield being 745 mm Hg.
At 06:37 visibility dropped to 800 m. The meteorological station officer did not inform air traffic control, although he was aware of this significant drop in visibility. Shortly afterward a visibility of 608 m was registered, which was below airport landing minima. This value was not noted by the met station officer and thus not passed on to ATC. At 06:38:53 the flight reported at 400 m. The crew was then instructed to contact the Samara Landing controller, which they did. At 06:40 UCT air traffic control contacted the met station to inquire about the cloud base and horizontal visibility. The met officer reported fog with 800 m visibility but did not mention the cloud base. The cloud base according to the latest ATIS information was 490 m. The actual cloud base measured at the time of the approach was about 30 m.
At 06:40:10, at a speed of 380 km/h, the flight engineer lowered the landing gear and the captain trimmed the stabilizer. At 06:40:43, at a speed of 350 km/h, the flaps were extended to 20 degrees. At the same time, the Tu-134 was 10 km on finals, the controller reported the (incorrect) visibility of ""800 m in fog"". At 06:41:09., 8 km out, at a speed of 320 km/h, the flaps were set at 30 degrees. 
At 06:41:45 the airplane passed the Outer Marker at 200 m. The navigator failed to inform the crew that they had passed the Outer Marker. Thus the pilot did not inform the controller, in order to obtain landing clearance. When the controller inquired about their position, the crew reported ready for landing. At 06:41:55 they were cleared to land. The vertical rate of descent was 6 m/s, which exceeded the recommended rate of descent. The aircraft passed the Inner Marker at a height of 60 m, and a vertical rate of descent of 5,5 m/s with a lateral deviation from the runway axis to the right, no less than 40 m with a further tendency to the right. At decision height the crew had not established positive visual contact with the approach lights. The approach was continued until the airplane contacted the ground, at 06:42:33, 300 m short of the runway and 100 m to the right of the extended centreline.

All 82 passengers and eight crew members were killed. The airplane operated on Ethiopian Airlines flight ET409 from Beirut International Airport (BEY) to Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD).
Instruments meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and the flight was on an instrument flight plan. It was night in dark lighting conditions with reported isolated cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms in the area.
Flight ET409 was initially cleared by ATC on a LATEB 1 D Standard Instrument Departure (SID) from runway 21. Just before takeoff, ATC changed the clearance to an ""immediate right turn direct Chekka"".
The Boeing 737 took off from runway 21 at 02:36. After takeoff ATC instructed ET409 to turn right on a heading of 315° and change frequencies and contact Beirut Control. ET409 acknowledged the clearance and continued a right turn. ATC instructed ET409 to turn left heading 270°, which was acknowledged. The flight continued the climbing left turn to heading 270° but did not maintain that heading. The aircraft continued on a southerly track. Just prior to reaching altitude of 7700 feet, the stick shaker activated, sounding for a period of 29 seconds. Meanwhile the airplane reached an angle of attack (AOA) of 32° and began a descent to 6000 feet. When the stick shaker ceased, the aircraft began to climb again. At 02:40:56, just prior to reaching 9000 feet, the stick shaker activated again, sounding for a period of 26 seconds.

After reaching 9000 feet the aircraft made a sharp left turn and descended rapidly. The maximum registered bank angle was 118° left and the airplane reached a maximum registered speed was 407.5 knots at a G load of 4.412. The airplane disappeared from the radar screen and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea at 02:41:30.";02:41;Boeing 737-8AS (WL);Ethiopian Airlines;Monday 25 January 2010

The weather in Seville at the time of arrival was forecast to be stormy with variable rain and winds. The visibility, reduced by the heavy rain, was in excess of 2,000 m (RVR) at the runway 27 threshold.
The runway in use at Seville was runway 27, which had CAT I visual and precision radio navigation landing aids.
While in autopilot, the aircraft captured the ILS localizer as it neared Seville, at a distance of 11 NM from the runway 27 threshold.
Flight 2652 was cleared to land on runway 27 some nine minutes prior to its arrival time and before descending below the transition level, which was at 7,500 ft above sea level.
The control tower reported the wind about three minutes prior to landing, which at that time was from 240° at 15 kt. The runway was wet and it was raining heavily. The crew was told to proceed on course to Seville at their discretion and in accordance with their procedures.
With the tower's clearance, they captured the glideslope early, far above the 2,000 ft specified in the published AIP procedure and descended along the ILS glideslope without significant deviations from the localize and glidepath until they were below 1,000 ft AGL and with the runway in sight. Established on the glideslope with the gear down and flaps 30°, they disengaged the autopilot at about 700 ft and shortly thereafter they started to climb above the glideslope. The aircraft then descended to the runway at very high descent rates. The EGPWS SINK RATE and PULL-UP warnings sounded shortly before touchdown.
The airplane landed in the middle of an intense rain storm. Personnel in the control tower saw a flame or glow on the right side of the aircraft. During the hard impact with the runway at the aiming point, some 300 m beyond the threshold, the right main gear leg collapsed, pivoting backwards and partially detaching. The crew was able to maintain steering control of the aircraft, which came to a stop after a 900-m landing run. Full reverse thrusters were used to decelerate the airplane. The entire landing roll took place on the paved runway surface. Only at the end of the run did part of the airplane, the right wingtip, touch the ground in an area beyond the paved asphalt.
After coming to a stop, and lacking the support from the right leg, the aircraft was being held up by its left leg and right engine, which is forward of the airplane's center of gravity, as a result of which the aircraft tilted backwards until the tail touched the ground during the final seconds of braking.
There was no fuel leak and no fire. The captain gave the evacuation order, which was carried out using the four doors on both sides of the airplane.
Due to the final nose-up pitch of the aircraft, the front doors were at a significant height above the ground. As a result, the emergency evacuation ramps were inclined at an excessive angle that hindered the exit of the airplane's occupants.";10:34;Boeing 737-6D6;Air Algérie;Saturday 18 March 2006

The weather was fine with a recorded wind speed of 5 kt (9 km/h) from the north-north-west and a temperature of 12 °C.
Witnesses familiar with the aircraft type reported that the take-off roll along runway 17 was longer than normal. After becoming airborne, the aircraft was observed to yaw left. The aircraft performed a shallow climbing left turn while maintaining a relatively level pitch and roll attitude. Airservices Australia Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated the aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 160 ft above ground level while tracking in an arc to the left of the runway centreline. The aircraft collided with a building at the DFO Essendon retail area.
The aircraft subsequently  collided with the roof of a building at the DFO Essendon retail are and associated concrete parapet before coming to rest in the building’s rear car park. Examination determined that, at impact the aircraft was configured with 10° of flap and that the landing gear was in the extended and locked position.

All 46 on board were killed.
Mérida Airport is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of 5010 feet. Terrain in the valley rises from 1000 to 19.500 feet. Arrivals and departures have to use the Rio Chama corridor to the west of the airport. Runway 07 is used for landings and takeoffs have to be performed in the opposite direction, from runway 25. 
Santa Bárbara Airlines however used an unpublished approach and departure procedure which let the aircraft use a valley to the northeast of the airport. This procedure saved about 15 minutes of flying time on the route to Caracas.
After all passengers had boarded for flight 518 to Caracas, it took about 30 minutes for the pilots to arrive at the aircraft. Being late, they immediately started the engines while simultaneously asking for permission to do so.
Because an Avior Airlines flight was approaching the airport, the crew were told to expedite their departure or wait for the arrival of the Avior aircraft. The flight crew decided to go and began taxiing 2 minutes and 40 seconds after startup. Consequently the AHRS (attitude and heading reference) system of the airplane was unusable. The aircraft needed to remain still for 3 minutes after the battery is turned on so that all gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers can be stabilized and synchronized.
The AHRS provides attitude information for aircraft, including roll, pitch and yaw. The captain possibly expected to re-initialize the system while they were at cruising altitude.
After departure from runway 25 the crew planned to use the unpublished procedure. Climbing through clouds a 180-degree turn was initiated. Using the unreliable magnetic compass, the flight made a 270 degree turn, heading towards rising terrain. The captain took over control from the copilot. When visual contact with terrain was regained, the crew noted they were heading for mountains. The captain tried to avoid rising terrain but the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 4100 m (13.400 feet).";ca 17:00;ATR 42-300;Santa Bárbara Airlines;Thursday 21 February 2008

The ATR 72-500 operated as scheduled passenger flight from Medan with intended destination of Meulaboh Airport. On board IW1252 were two pilots, one observer pilot, two flight attendants and 67 passengers. The pilot in command acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the second in command acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM).
At 10:54, the flight attendant of IW1252 advised the pilot that the boarding process was completed. The pilot then requested push back and engine start clearance from the Medan Ground controller , which was approved.
At 10:56, IW1252 requested taxi clearance to the Medan Ground controller and was instructed to taxi to runway 23 following U2 taxi route, which was from apron V to holding point runway 23 on taxiway C, via taxiway U - T - and B.
At 10:57, flight JT197 reported to the Medan Tower controller that the aircraft was established on the localizer of runway 23. The Medan Tower controller acknowledged this and issued a landing clearance with additional information regarding the wind conditions and barometric pressure.
At 10:58, IW1252 contacted Medan Tower and was instructed to continue to taxi and hold on short of runway 23. Flight IW1252 requested to depart via the taxiway D intersection with the intention to expedite the departure. This was approved. Taxiway D was a Rapid Exit Taxiway (RET) for runway 05.
At 10:59, IW1252 advised Medan Tower that the aircraft was close to reaching runway 23. Medan Tower then requested confirmation that IW1252 was ready for immediate departure. There was no reply and the Medan Tower controller repeated the request and received the reply that IW1252 was able for immediate departure.
Medan Tower intended to let IW1252 depart immediately after flight JT197 had landed, since there was another arriving aircraft behind JT197.
At 11:00:01, the Medan Tower controller radioed: ""Wings Abadi one two five two behind traffic Lion short final landed passing line up behind runway two three from intersection delta additional clearance after departure direct Meulaboh"".
At 11:00:13, IW1252 read back: ""after departure direct to Meulaboh Wings Abadi one two five two"". Thereafter, IW1252 continued the taxi for line up on runway 23.
At 11:00:32, IW1252 crossed the runway holding position marking (yellow line). At the same time, the Medan Tower controller was monitoring the distance of the second arriving aircraft on the radar display.
As JT197 was on short final, the flight crew noted IW1252 ahead and assumed that the ATR aircraft would not enter the runway. Therefore, the PF decided to continue the landing approach and focused on handling the aircraft.
At 11:00:50, JT197 touched down and the attention of the Medan Tower controller changed back from the radar display to the runway environment.
IW1252 by then crossed the runway side marking (white line) and continued to enter the runway. The flight crew of JT197 saw that the ATR was entering the runway.
At 11:00:56, the left wing of JT197 impacted with the right hand wing of IW1252.
The flight crew of JT197 subsequently radioed the Medan Tower controller that there was another aircraft on the runway and this was acknowledged. The Medan Tower supervisor on duty noticed two aircraft on the runway and the Medan Tower controller panicked. Thereafter, the Medan Tower supervisor took over the communication of Medan Tower.
At 11:01:47, the pilot of JT197 contacted the Medan Tower twice, and received a response at 11:02:01 by the Medan Tower supervisor, who then instructed them to vacate the runway via taxiway G.
At 11:02:05, JT197 advised the Medan Tower that the aircraft had touched down and asked why there was another aircraft on runway 23. The Medan Tower supervisor requested the pilot to standby.
At 11:02:30, the Medan Tower supervisor instructed the other arriving aircraft pilot to overshoot due to traffic. The other arriving aircraft pilot requested to make orbit to the left on final approach which was approved.
While the Boeing 737-900 was taxiing to the parking bay, the Medan Tower supervisor issued takeoff clearance to IW1252, with additional clearance to turn left heading 315 after airborne. IW1252 responded that they were unable to depart. The Medan Tower supervisor then instructed the IW1252 pilot to hold on the runway. 
At 11:04:40, the Medan Tower supervisor again issued takeoff clearance IW1252, to which the pilot responded by requesting to return to the apron for inspection of any damage to the aircraft. The Medan Tower supervisor approved the request and instructed them to vacate the runway via taxiway E then to contact Medan Ground.
As the ATR was taxiing back to the apron another departing aircraft was cleared to line up on runway 23, with takeoff clearance being issued at 11:07:21. 
At 11:08:55, JT197 advised the Medan Ground controller pf the possibility of aircraft debris on the runway that might become hazard to the other aircraft. The Medan Ground controller acknowledged and relayed the information to Medan Tower supervisor. At 11:10:26, the flight that had just departed advised Medan Tower that there was Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on the runway. 
Despite these reports, Medan Tower issued landing clearance to another arriving aircraft at 11:10:44.
At 11:14, after landing on runway 23, the other arriving flight advised Medan Tower that there was FOD on the runway. It took until 11:31 for the runway to be closed. After all the debris were collected and runway cleaned, the runway was reopened and resumed to normal operation at 11:55.";11:00;Boeing 737-9GPER;Lion Air;Thursday 3 August 2017

All on board were killed in the accident, including Polish President Lech Kaczynski.
The airplane departed Warszawa-Okecie Airport (WAW), Poland at 07:27 local time, carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, several Members of Parliament, President of the National Bank of Poland Slawomir Skrzypek, Chief of General Staff Franciszek Gagor, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Kremer and a number of passengers and crew members. 
During the flight the crew was in contact with air traffic controllers at Minsk, Moscow and Smolensk. The crew also was in contact with the crew of a Polish Air Force Yakovlev 40 passenger plane that had landed at Smolensk Air Base 90 minutes ahead of the Presidential flight.
At about 10:14 the flight descended through an altitude of 7500 m. Minsk Control radioed that the visibility at Smolensk Air Base was 400 m due to fog. The same conditions were transmitted to the crew when they contacted the controller at Smolensk. About 10:25 the pilot of the Yak-40 on the ground at Smolensk radioed that horizontal visibility was 400 m and vertical visibility about 50 m. Shortly afterwards they reported that an Ilyushin 76 transport plane had diverted to an alternate airfield after two attempts to land.
The crew continued preparations for an approach to runway 26 at the Smolensk Air Base. The cockpit door was open and during the approach there were two passengers present on the flight deck.
Meanwhile, visibility worsened to 200 m. This information was transmitted to the crew at 10:37. The crew requested permission to carry out a 'trial' approach to decision height (100 m) and asked the controller to expect a go around.
About 18 seconds before impact the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) sounded: ""Pull up"", followed by an aural warning: ""TERRAIN AHEAD"". About 5 seconds before impact the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected in order to execute a go around. The airplane contacted upsloping terrain at a distance of about 1100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centreline. The aircraft height at that point was 15 m below the level of the runway threshold. The left wing struck a large tree causing the airplane to roll inverted.

The mishap aircraft terminated its mission and returned to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. The crew and mission personnel evacuated the aircraft safely without injury.
The mishap occurred during operations in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). The mishap crew had begun aerial refuelling with a KC-135, when the mishap crew and personnel aboard heard and felt a loud bang throughout the midsection of the aircraft. The crew suspended refuelling to evaluate the aircraft to checkout their systems and evaluate the aircraft for any damage. Finding nothing apparently wrong, the crew re-latched to the tanker and attempted to continue the refuelling when another series of loud noises and vibrations were heard and felt throughout the aircraft.
Personnel aboard the KC-135 observed a stream of vapour and fuel streaming from the E-8 and alerted the crew. The crew checked for damage through a rear window and observed fuel streaming from at least two holes in the left wing, just inboard of the number two engine. The crew opted to terminate the mission and return to Al Udeid. Maintenance personnel then examined the airplane and found that the number two main fuel tank had ruptured, causing extensive damage to the wing of the airplane.";null;Boeing E-8C (707);United States Air Force - USAF;Friday 13 March 2009

The aircraft operated on a cargo charter flight with 1680 kg cargo on board. It took off from Kathmandu at 07:44 UTC at flight 409, bound for Lukla.
It was the 5th flight of the aircraft to Lukla and with the same set of crew. Lukla weather was cloudy, but visibility and ceiling was reported to be fine after an hour of heavy rain. On first contact flight 409 reported abeam Rumjatar descending out of 11300 ft at 08:10 UTC. Lukla Tower provided the latest weather at the airport, as well as enroute weather relayed by 9N-AGU, an AS350 helicopter that had departed Lukla for Kathmandu. Almost 4 minutes after the first contact, Tower informed flight 409 about the deteriorating weather. The right base leg was covered by lifting fog though there was no rain and the final approach area was still visible.
Weather deteriorated further and Tower regularly updated the flight crew. About 30 seconds after flight 409 reported entering valley, Lukla Tower again informed about the latest status of the further deteriorating weather. Flight 409 then informed that they would come up to Bhatkeko Daada and then decide. The pilot also informed they could see some bright spots.
While continuing approach, both cockpit crew sighted the runway at 9100 ft. That was 64 seconds before the impact. While continuing approach the aircraft deviated to the right by almost 15 degrees and erroneously descended too low to 8500 ft whereas threshold height is 8900 ft (on Kathmandu QNH, whereas per AIP it is 9200 ft). 
The flight crew attempted to climb and reach the threshold in a landing configuration. The aircraft pitched up to over 25°, the airspeed dropped and the aircraft stalled. Subsequently its left wing first hit a small tree and then impacted the sloping terrain 130 feet short of the runway.

The aircraft departed Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, at 23:21 hours local time on May 18. Scheduled departure time was 22:45 hours. Destination of the flight was Cairo, Egypt.
Last contact with the flight was at FL370, about 02:29 hours. According to Greek military authorities their primary radar showed the aircraft suddenly taking a 90 degree turn left, followed by a 360 degrees turn in the opposite direction as it descended from FL370 to FL150 before disappearing off radars.
The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were both recovered from the sea bed on June 16, 2016. 

The Egyptian authorities found that:
- The flight recorders stopped operating while the aircraft was in cruise at an altitude of 37,000 feet;
- The aircraft systems sent ACARS messages indicating the presence of smoke in toilets and the avionics bay;
- The data from the data recorder confirms these messages;
- The playback of the cockpit voice recorder reveals, in particular, that the crew mentioned the existence of a fire on board;
- Several pieces of debris were retrieved from the accident site. Some of these had signs of having been subject to high temperatures, and traces of soot.

On December 15, 2016, investigators reported that traces of explosives were found on several victims. Egyptian authorities determined that there had been a malicious act. The formal investigation per ICAO Annex 13 was stopped and further investigation fell within the sole jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.

The aircraft was scheduled to operate three commercial air transport (cargo) sectors: from Athens to Bergamo, then to Paris Charles de Gaulle, and finally East Midlands.
The co-pilot completed the pre-flight external inspection of the aircraft in good light, and found nothing amiss. The departure from Athens was uneventful, but a combination of factors affecting Bergamo (including poor weather, absence of precision approach aids, and work in progress affecting the available landing distance) led the crew to decide to route directly to Paris, where a normal landing was carried out.
The aircraft departed Paris for East Midlands at 00:40 hrs UTC, loaded with 10 tonnes of freight, 8 tonnes of fuel (the minimum required was 5.6 tonnes), and with the co-pilot as Pilot Flying.
Once established in the cruise, the flight crew obtained the latest ATIS information from East Midlands, which stated that runway 27 was in use, although there was a slight tailwind, and Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) were in force. They planned to exchange control at about FL100 in the descent, for the commander to carry out a Category III autoland. However, as they neared their destination, the weather improved, LVPs were cancelled, and the flight crew re-briefed for an autopilot approach, followed by a manual landing, to be carried out by the co-pilot. The landing was to be with Flap 30, Autobrake 2, and idle reverse thrust.
The final ATIS transmission which the flight crew noted before landing stated that the wind was 130/05 kt, visibility was 3,000 metres in mist, and the cloud was broken at 600 ft aal.
The captain established radio contact with the tower controller, and the aircraft was cleared to land; the surface wind was transmitted as 090/05 kt. The touchdown was unremarkable, and the autobrake functioned normally, while the co-pilot applied idle reverse thrust on the engines.
As the aircraft’s speed reduced through approximately 60 kt, the co-pilot handed control to the commander, who then made a brake pedal application to disengage the autobrake system. However, the system remained engaged, so he made a second, more positive, brake application. The aircraft ""shuddered"" and rolled slightly left-wing-low as the lower part of the left main landing gear detached. The captain used the steering tiller to try to keep the aircraft tracking straight along the runway centreline, but it came to a halt slightly off the centreline, resting on its right main landing gear, the remains of the left main landing gear leg, and the left engine lower cowl. 
The two crew members were uninjured and there was no fire.";02:28;Boeing 737-476SF;Air Contractors;Tuesday 29 April 2014

All three occupants were killed.
Te aircraft initially arrived at Nice-Côte d'Azur Airport (NCE) following a flight from Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Turkey. Three passengers deplaned at Nice. Since the parking area at Nice was full, the airplane was to be ferried to Le Castellet. 
Takeoff was accomplished at 14:56 hours local time and the aircraft climbed to FL160 for a short flight to Le Castellet.
At the destination, the crew was cleared to perform a visual approach to runway 13. The autopilot and the auto-throttle were disengaged, the gear was down and the flaps in the landing position. The GND SPOILER UNARM message, indicating nonarming of the ground spoilers, was displayed on the EICAS and the associated single chime aural warning was triggered. This message remained displayed on the EICAS until the end of the flight since the crew forgot to arm the ground spoilers during the approach. 
At a height of 25 ft, while the aircraft was flying over the runway threshold slightly below the theoretical descent path, a SINK RATE warning was triggered. The pilot flying corrected the flight path and the touchdown of the main landing gear took place 15 metres after the touchdown zone, which is 365 metres from the threshold, and slightly left of the centre line of runway 13. The ground spoilers, not armed, did not automatically deploy. The crew braked and actuated the deployment of the thrust reversers, which did not deploy completely. The hydraulic pressure available at brake level slightly increased. The deceleration of the aeroplane was slow. 
Four seconds after touchdown, a MASTER WARNING was triggered. A second MASTER WARNING was generated five seconds later.
The nose landing gear touched down for the first time 785 metres beyond the threshold before the aeroplane's pitch attitude increased again, causing a loss of contact of the nose gear with the ground. The aircraft crossed the runway centre line to the right, the crew correcting this by a slight input on the rudder pedals to the left. They applied a strong nose-down input and the nose gear touched down on the runway a second time, 1050 metres beyond the threshold.
The speedbrakes were then manually actuated by the crew with an input on the speed brake control, which then deployed the panels. Maximum thrust from the thrust reversers was reached one second later. The aircraft at this time was 655 metres from the runway end and its path began to curve to the left. In response to this deviation, the crew made a sharp input on the right rudder pedal, to the stop, and an input on the right brake, but failed to correct the trajectory. The aeroplane, skidding to the right, ran off the runway to the left 385 metres from the runway end at a ground speed of approximately 95 knots.
It struck a runway edge light, the PAPI of runway 31, a metal fence then trees and caught fire instantly.

The flight was uneventful since the first departure from Makassar until commencing the approach at Manokwari.
At 08:15 hours local time, the aircraft departed Sorong to Manokwari. On board were two pilots, four flight attendants and 146 passengers. On this flight, the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM).
At 08:31, the pilot made first contact with the Rendani Tower controller and informed that the aircraft was descending from FL230 and requested weather information. The Rendani Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind was calm, ground visibility 6 km, cloud FEW CB 1,400 feet, temperature and dew point 26/25°C.
At 08:36, Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to descend to 11,000 feet and to report when on Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).
At 08:38, the pilot informed that they were in VMC and passing altitude 13,000 feet at 32 NM from the ZQ NDB (Non-Directional Beacon).
The Rendani Tower controller instructed to fly overhead, descend to circuit altitude, join right downwind runway 35, and to report when overhead Manokwari.
At 08:44, the pilot reported that the aircraft was over Manokwari and the Tower controller informed the pilot that the visibility had changed to 5 km. Two minutes later Rendani Tower instructed the pilot to continue approach and to report on right base runway 35.
At 08:49, at approximately 600 feet, the PIC as PM took over control by called ""I have control"" and the SIC replied ""You have control"". A few seconds later the pilot reported that the aircraft was on final runway 35, and Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to report when the runway 35 in sight. The pilot immediately replied that the runway was in sight, which was acknowledged by Rendani Tower who then issued landing clearance with additional information that the wind was calm and the runway condition wet.
At approximately 550 feet, the PIC instructed the SIC turn on the wiper and reconfirmed to SIC that the runway was in sight. Between altitude 500 feet to 200 feet, the EGPWS aural warnings ""Sink Rate"" and ""Pull Up"" sounded.
At 08:50, the aircraft touched down on runway 35. The spoilers deployed and the pilot activated the thrust reversers. The crew did not feel significant deceleration.
The aircraft failed to stop on the runway and overran by approximately 20 meters from the end of runway pavement. After the aircraft stopped, the PIC commanded ""Evacuate"" through the Passenger Address (PA) system. The Rendani Tower Controller saw that the aircraft had overrun, activated the crash bell and then informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) that there was an aircraft overrun after landing on runway 35.
All the flight crew and passengers evacuated the aircraft and transported to the terminal building safely.
The aircraft sustained serious damage on the nose landing gear, nose section lower fuselage, and both engine fan blades.";08:51;Boeing 737-33A;Sriwijaya Air;Wednesday 31 May 2017

None of the 3 crewmembers or 50 passengers on board was injured. The airplane sustained damage to the number-two engine inlet, the first officer's windshield, and a 14- by 4-inch section of fuselage skin just below the windshield seal on the first officer's side. 
The captain reported that the airplane was on departure roll and had accelerated past 80 knots when a flock of birds began to fly south over the runway. The airplane was traveling at approximately 110 knots when one of the birds hit the airplane, cracking the first officer's windshield and causing a few shards of glass to fall into the cockpit and onto the first officer. The captain immediately rejected the takeoff and stopped on the runway to assess the damage. 

A postflight inspection by maintenance personnel revealed that the airplane had struck two wild turkeys. One turkey hit the intake of the number-two engine, slightly damaging the forward lip of the engine intake cowl. No bird remains went through the engine. The other turkey hit just below the first officer's windshield, where a turkey leg and foot were still lodged. Closer examination of the airplane revealed that the second turkey hit the nose sheet metal at the base of the first officer's windshield, bending the windshield support structure and causing the windshield to crack upward from that location. The second turkey penetrated the area beneath the lower support structure, went through the pressure bulkhead, and entered the back of the instrument panel but did not penetrate either the windshield or its supporting structure.";10:15;Canadair CL-600-2B19 Regional Jet CRJ-200ER;null;Saturday 9 March 2002

There were no personal injuries on the 3 crew and 16 passengers on board.
Flight F7-250 had departed Leipzig Airport (LEJ), Germany on a scheduled service to Paris-CDG. The copilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM).
The flight was cleared to perform an ILS approach to runway 27R. The aircraft intercepted the glide slope at 07:25. 
The tower controller then cleared the flight to land and reported wind from 200° at 12 kt. 
The captain again advises the OPL by reminding him when to set up the aircraft for landing.
At an altitude of 2,300 ft the landing configuration was set (20° flap) and the approach target speed of 123 kt was selected.  At a height of 1000 ft, the approach was stable and the runway was in sight. At a height of about 400 ft, the PF disconnected the autopilot and at 200 ft, the decision height, the crew decided to continue the approach.
Passing 50 ft, the PF gradually returned the power levers to the ""flight idle"" position and initiated the flare. Shortly before touchdown the captain pulled on the control column to the maximum nose-up value (11°) and the attitude reached a value of 5°. The wheels of the main landing gear hit the ground hard, and the airplane was at an indicated speed of about 120 kt. The airplane then bounced. The copilot then pushed the control column forward, causing a nose down attitude. De PM then again pulled on the controls and the aircraft bounced a second time.

The flight was carried out by DC-9-51 N763NC. After takeoff, at some point below 4,000 feet altitude, when the slats were retracted, the MASTER CAUTION light illuminated. The co-pilot, who was pilot flying, observed the RUDDER CONTROL MANUAL annunciator light and then saw that the right hydraulic system pressure was about 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSI). The right engine hydraulic pump switch was selected to 'off' and the flight was continued while the captain referred to the NWA DC-9 Cockpit Operating Manual (COM) to complete the procedures. He also discussed the problem with maintenance control on the ground. The approach and landing at Minneapolis were briefed thoroughly. Approximately 18:50, the captain contacted dispatch to request that they ""call out the trucks"" for their arrival. At 19:01 the captain radioed to MSP center ""ah we got a hydraulic problem, we're gonna go ahead and declare an emergency. ah everything should be okay but just gonna have to land a little faster and we're gonna have the trucks standing and everything."" The landing gear was extended early in the approach because the crew was uncertain if they would have to use the Emergency Gear Extension Handle. This was not necessary as the gear extended successfully. The first officer flew a long slow downwind from Farmington to a downwind leg to runway 22. He turned onto the localizer course at an altitude about 3,000 feet. The flight was then cleared for the approach to runway 22. A safe landing was carried out at 19:23. After landing the flaps were retracted and the After Landing checklist was completed. The crew received taxi instructions, and after crossing runway 30L, he made a right turn onto taxiway A. They made a slight gradual turn into the gate area. He had just started to turn into the gate from taxiway A when the nose wheel steering failed. The first officer then advised Ground Control that they were experiencing steering problems and would probably have to be towed to the gate. He then called MAINT and told them the same thing. Then the captain 
lost the brakes. The first officer stated that he saw the captain's hands ""come up"" and apply reverse thrust. The airplane came to a stop. The first officer stated that he called maintenance again and told them that they had lost steering and brakes and that they needed to have the airplane chocked. maintenance asked if they would shut down the engines and the captain said, no, he needed them first officer the reversers. The first officer stressed that they needed to get somebody out there right away; they were in a very precarious situation. maintenance said they would have somebody out as soon as they could. The first officer made a PA announcement to the passengers telling them that the airplane was experiencing a system malfunction; they were going to stay put and then be towed to the gate. At 19:36 they began to slowly roll forward. The captain tried using the engine reverse thrust to stop the airplane, but the thrust reversers did not deploy.

The flight crew consisted of three pilots: a line training captain who occupied the left seat, a first officer under line training in the right seat and an additional first officer who occupied the flight deck jump seat. The first officer under line training was the pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful.
The flight was descending for Schiphol and passed overhead Flevoland at about 8500 ft. At that time the aural landing gear warning sounded.
The aircraft continued and was then directed by Air Traffic Control towards runway 18R for an ILS approach and landing. The standard procedure for runway 18R prescribes that the aircraft is lined up at least 8 NM from the runway threshold at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glidepath is then approached and intercepted from below. Lining up at a distance between 5 and 8 NM is allowed when permitted by ATC. 
Flight 1951 was vectored for a line up at approximately 6 NM at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glide slope was now approached from above.
The crew performed the approach with one of the two autopilot and autothrottle engaged. 
The landing gear was selected down and flaps 15 were set. While descending through 1950 feet, the radio altimeter value suddenly changed to -8 feet. And again the aural landing gear warning sounded.
This could be seen on the captain’s (left-hand) primary flight display. The first officer’s (right-hand) primary flight display, by contrast, indicated the correct height, as provided by the right-hand system. The left hand radio altimeter system, however, categorised the erroneous altitude reading as a correct one, and did not record any error. In turn, this meant that it was the erroneous altitude reading that was used by various aircraft systems, including the autothrottle. The crew were unaware of this, and could not have known about it. The manuals for use during the flight did not contain any procedures for errors in the radio altimeter system. In addition, the training that the pilots had undergone did not include any detailed system information that would have allowed them to understand the significance of the problem.
When the aircraft started to follow the glidepath because of the incorrect altitude reading, the autothrottle moved into the ‘retard flare’ mode. This mode is normally only activated in the final phase of the landing, below 27 feet. This was possible because the other preconditions had also been met, including flaps at (minimum) position 15. The thrust from both engines was accordingly reduced to a minimum value (approach idle). This mode was shown on the primary flight displays as ‘RETARD’. However, the right-hand autopilot, which was activated, was receiving the correct altitude from the right-hand radio altimeter system. Thus the autopilot attempted to keep the aircraft flying on the glide path for as long as possible. This meant that the aircraft’s nose continued to rise, creating an increasing angle of attack of the wings. This was necessary in order to maintain the same lift as the airspeed reduced.
In the first instance, the pilots’ only indication that the autothrottle would no longer maintain the pre-selected speed of 144 knots was the RETARD display. When the speed fell below this value at a height of 750 feet, they would have been able to see this on the airspeed indicator on the primary flight displays. When subsequently, the airspeed reached 126 knots, the frame of the airspeed indicator also changed colour and started to flash. The artificial horizon also showed that the nose attitude of the aircraft was becoming far too high. The cockpit crew did not respond to these indications and warnings. The reduction in speed and excessively high pitch attitude of the aircraft were not recognised until the approach to stall warning (stick shaker) went off at an altitude of 460 feet. 
The first officer responded immediately to the stick shaker by pushing the control column forward and also pushing the throttle levers forward. The captain however, also responded to the stick shaker commencing by taking over control. Assumingly the result of this was that the first officer’s selection of thrust was interrupted. The result of this was that the autothrottle, which was not yet switched off, immediately pulled the throttle levers back again to the position where the engines were not providing any significant thrust. Once the captain had taken over control, the autothrottle was disconnected, but no thrust was selected at that point. Nine seconds after the commencement of the first approach to stall warning, the throttle levers were pushed fully forward, but at that point the aircraft had already stalled and the height remaining, of about 350 feet, was insufficient for a recovery.
According to the last recorded data of the digital flight data recorder the aircraft was in a 22° ANU and 10° Left Wing Down (LWD) position at the moment of impact.
The airplane impacted farmland. The horizontal stabilizer and both main landing gear legs were separated from the aircraft and located near the initial impact point. The left and right engines had detached from the aircraft.
The aft fuselage, with vertical stabilizer, was broken circumferentially forward of the aft passenger doors and had sustained significant damage. The fuselage had ruptured at the right side forward of the wings. The forward fuselage section, which contained the cockpit and seat rows 1 to 7, had been significantly disrupted. The rear fuselage section was broken circumferentially around row 28.";10:26;Boeing 737-8F2;THY Turkish Airlines;Wednesday 25 February 2009

When the crew did not acquire the required visual references at the missed approach point, they executed a missed approach. On the second approach, the captain flew outbound from the beacon at 3000 feet asl until turning on the inbound track. It was decided that if visual contact of the surface was made at any time during the approach procedure, they would continue below the MDA in anticipation of the required visual references. The captain initiated a constant descent at approximately 1500 feet per minute with 10 degrees flap selected. The FO occasionally caught glimpses of the surface.

After passing the initial approach fix they entered a cloud, and noticed that there was ""quite a bit of wind"" which they had to compensate for. Moments later, the first officer noticed that they were picking up a trace amount of rime ice on the windscreen; however, since neither pilot saw any ice on the wings, the de-icing boots were never activated. As they neared the final approach fix (FAF), they ""added a notch"" of approach flaps, and then added full flaps when they crossed the FAF. After reaching the minimum descent altitude, they acquired the field and the visual approach slope indicator (VASI). Once established on the VASI, the approach to landing seemed normal until reaching approximately 100 feet above ground level. The crew then experienced what they described as a ""burble,"" and the airplane rolled ""steeply"" to the right, striking the surface of the runway overrun area. After landing and taxiing to the ramp, the flight crew conducted a postflight inspection of the airplane.

He had been on duty more than 11 hours and performed nine flights. The accident flight, which was planned to be his last flight of the day, was to take place in darkness. The weather was above minima but IMC. During the pre-flight check the crew noted a failure in the RH Main Bus. This caused a number of systems to be unavailable, a.o.: the autopilot, the left hand EFIS, LH/RH Flight Director, LH RMI, EFIS Comparators, and the no. 2 engine anti-ice start bleed valve being open (as a result of this, the ITT on this engine was approximately 15°C higher than normal at selected power on this engine). Despite the fact that, according to the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), taking off for a flight with any of the Main Buses inoperative was not allowed, the captain decided to continue.
During taxi to runway 05 the aircraft was cleared for a Chunan One (CN1) departure. The aircraft took off at 19:29:09. 
Because of the autopilot was not available, the captain now had to fly manually. In addition, the flying had to be performed without support from the yaw-damper that was also inoperative as a result of the RH Main Bus failure. This means that more active rudder control was required, while the DFDR-data shows that such input was not made.
The more than 30°C ITT-split between the engines, of which approximately 15°C was caused by the RH Engine Anti-ice Start Bleed Valve being open, did have little effect on the behavior of the aircraft in the initial start-sequence. But when the crew, 30 seconds after lift off, disengaged CTOT and started to manually adjust the RH PLA downwards, possibly to get equal ITT in the engines, this ended up in a torque-split of more than 13% between the engines, with the RH engine being lower in torque. This asymmetry tended to yaw and roll the aircraft to the right and required higher aileron input than normal to the left in order to keep the aircraft at a constant bank angle. 
Normally the flaps are retracted at around 1,000 feet during initial climb. In this flight the flap retraction was not initiated until the first officer was reading the Climb Check List in which the flap position should be checked and verified. Flap retraction was done just prior to the aircraft reaching VFE15 (175 KIAS, which is the maximum allowed speed with flaps extended).
When the climb power was set, a symmetric PLA change was made. However, due to the earlier RH Power Lever Angle (PLA) pull in combination with the normal backlash in the power lever cables between the PLA and the HMU, the RH engine torque was decreased while the LH engine torque remained unchanged. Hence, a torque split occurred. This resulted in an increased aerodynamic asymmetry giving a force tending to yaw and bank the aircraft to the right. Consequently, still more aileron input was required in order to maintain a correct bank angle.
Because the behavior of the aircraft was very different from what the captain was used to, the need for continuous manual flying under IMC-conditions may have totally occupied his capacity. This could also explain why, during this phase of flight, he did not observe the aircraft starting a turn to the right 78 seconds after take off instead of continuing the left turn for a heading of 260. At about this same time, and for no obvious reasons, the positive rate of climb decreased and the aircraft leveled out at approximately 2,000 feet for a short time instead of continuing the climb to its assigned altitude of 3,000 feet. The captain's actions could be interpreted as signs that he might have been suffering from fatigue or spatial disorientation.
It is difficult to determine if the F/O was aware of the captain's deviation from the cleared departure route. All indications point to the fact that he was not aware or that he out of respect for the captain did not report of the deviations. For example, the F/O transmitted back to Taipei Approach 114 seconds after takeoff, ""Left 230, Bravo 12255,"" while at the same time the aircraft was in a right turn with a 21 degree right bank, passing through a heading of 312 degrees. In fact, his primary means for monitoring the flight were very limited due to dark, IMC-conditions since his EFIS instruments were black or flagged. This could also explain why the captain did not receive any support from the F/O about the flight becoming more and more uncontrolled. 
Not until 124 seconds after takeoff and 37 seconds prior to the last DFDR-recording did the captain state that he was having a problem with the heading and asked for help with the magnetic compass. At that time the aircraft was in a 24° right bank and 10° pitch up position and had a heading and roll rate by one degree per second. From that moment a continuous decrease in pitch angle was recorded down 
to -65,4° just prior to the impact. Just 19 seconds before the last DFDR-recording, with a heading of 022 and a bank angle of 36° to the right, the captain said ""Ask for a radar vector."" At this moment, he also initiates a short aileron input to the right, further increasing the bank angle.
The other crewmembers did not answer or give any notable response to the captain's request for help with the magnetic compass. The reason might be that they also were very confused about the situation and unable to take any relevant action. When the captain, 14 seconds before the last DFDR-recording, said ""Wah Sei!!! Everything is wrong."" the aircraft was in a 8,4° pitch down and the right bank angle was 47,5°. Finally, only 10 seconds before the last data point was recorded, the first officer responds by asking ""Sir, shall we look at this one? "". Pitch down was then 15,8° and the right roll angle 71,7°. 
In the last part of the flight the pitch and bank angles were at extreme values not to be experienced in normal operation. At this stage of the flight, the control inputs recorded are rapid aileron inputs to the right that further increased the adverse attitudes. The aircraft was then totally uncontrolled and the airspeed and sink rate increased dramatically. Four seconds before impact the Vmo warning started. The aircraft then crashed into the sea.";19:32;Saab 340B;Formosa Airlines;Wednesday 18 March 1998

The aircraft operator's maintenance organisation examined the aircraft and found that the left main landing gear drive shaft had severed as a result of fretting against a bleed air duct clamp tail. The bleed air duct clamp (jubilee clamp) had been fitted to the aircraft during an aircraft refurbishment program in September 2003.

The flight from Shanghai, China, was uneventful and a normal final approach was established to Copenhagen Airport's runway 22L at 1000 feet AGL with the autopilot off and the auto throttle engaged. The airspeed was 152 knots and the vertical speed was 830 feet/min. 
During the flare the pilot flying started to correct the rate of decent by increasing the pitch attitude. At touchdown the pitch attitude was 4.6°, the computed airspeed was 143 knots, the vertical speed was 160 feet/min. 
The aircraft touched down and bounced three times. After the first bounce, the ground spoilers automatically retracted and the auto braking system disarmed. A second bounce occurred followed by a third bounce. After the third bounce, the speed brakes handle was pulled either by the pilot flying or by thrust reverser command, which deployed the ground spoilers and the thrust reversers. 
The reversers were deployed in 11 seconds. During the deceleration, the pitch angle gradually increased to 10.5° and the aircraft suffered a tailstrike. At the same time the pilot flying felt an increasing pitch up attitude and decided to initiate a go-around. 
An initiation of a GA after thrust reverser activation is very risky and not an option according to the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM).
After the ground spoilers were retracted and the reversers were stowed, the pitch angle was decreased to 7.0°. At that time, the indicated airspeed was 117 knots. Engine power was applied and as the airspeed increased. The increase of the forward engine thrust caused a further nose up pitch moment, resulting in an increasing pitch angle of 11.9°.
During lift off the indicated airspeed (IAS) was 140 knots, which was 8 knots below the V2 calculated speed. The lower speed gave less lift and kept the main landing gear compressed. The result was less aft tail belly clearance, leading the second tail strike. During initial climb, the flight crew noticed a beeper aural warning and the tailstrike caution on the upper Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) display. The flight crew performed a tail strike Malfunction Check List and a Go Around Check List. The pilot not flying informed ATC about the go around and the tailstrike indication and that the pilots didn't have control problems with the aircraft.

According to the flight crew, the airplane was flying in smooth IMC conditions at FL200, with an area of ""moderate to heavy to extreme"" precipitation located about 30 miles to the northwest. As the airplane approached 20 miles from the weather, it began to experience moderate turbulence and rime ice on the windscreen. The pilot flying deviated course 40-degrees to the south. Turbulence increased further for about 10 seconds, and the airplane then entered an uncommanded left roll and dive. The autopilot disengaged and the pilot's electrically driven attitude indicator tumbled. The flight crew reduced the engine power levers to idle and were able to recover utilizing the copilot's vacuum driven attitude indicator. The airplane was returned to straight and level flight at an altitude of 8,000 feet; however, flight control instability persisted. The flight crew subsequently diverted to Tri-Cities Regional Airport (TRI), Blountville, Tennessee, where the airplane landed without further incident.

The flight was a regular passenger service from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Melbourne. The flight crew consisted of a captain, who was the pilot flying (PF) and a first officer, who was pilot monitoring (PM).
The approach to runway 34 at Melbourne airport was not equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), so a non-precision approach was performed, aided by PAPI lights. 
Flight data showed that the PF disengaged the autopilot at approximately 700 feet above ground level (AGL) and from that point until touchdown there was an increase in the frequency and magnitude of sidestick pitch control inputs by the PF.
In response to these inputs the aircraft’s autothrottle system varied the engine thrust to maintain a target speed, as per system design, and the aircraft pitch angles fluctuated between approximately -0.5° nose down and +5.0° nose up. The net result of the varying thrust settings and pitch angles was a fluctuating rate of descent between approximately 380 and 960 feet per minute.
Large sidestick inputs, specifically nose-down, also have the potential to inhibit the vertical speed reduction function, which is an automated function that provides some protection against touchdown at very high vertical speeds.
As the aircraft passed 300 feet a rate of descent of 960 feet per minute was recorded. This neared the operator’s maximum stabilised approach limit of 1000 feet per minute when below 500 feet AGL. As well as a high rate of descent, actual exceedances of the operator’s stabilisation criteria included: large changes to pitch inputted by the pilot flying, including negative pitch values, fluctuations in the rate of descent over a large range that were abnormal for the phase of flight, incorrect glide path. 
From approximately 250 feet AGL, the aircraft was trending low and continuing below the glide path. At this point the pilots would have been able to observe 3 red lights and one white light on the PAPI. This trend was allowed to continue until the aircraft was well below the desired glide path to the extent that the PAPI would have indicated 4 red lights from approximately 125 feet AGL. From this point the PF made numerous pitch commands which were mostly nose down. These included a full range nose down deflection at 24 feet AGL.
The company procedures and manufacturer’s recommendations dictated that if an approach becomes unstable below 500 feet AGL, a go-around must be initiated by the pilot flying (PF) and/or the pilot monitoring (PM) must alert the PF of the unstable approach and encourage a go-around.
At 60 feet AGL the captain moved the thrust levers forward momentarily into the TOGA (Take-off/Go Around) detent. The captain stated that this was done in response to a feeling that the aircraft was sinking below the path, and the intention was to reduce this sink by applying more thrust to the engines. The placement of the thrust lever into TOGA placed the aircraft automation into the go-around autopilot modes and changed the display on the primary flight display flight mode annunciator (FMA). The captain subsequently reduced the thrust levers.
The PM, on seeing the modes on the FMA change assumed that a go-around was being conducted and awaited further announcement from the captain. The PM reported noticing the thrust levers reducing and that the aircraft was not flaring and applied nose up input to the sidestick at the same time as the PF.
At the time of the occurrence there was no procedure on the A330 for the use of manual thrust for this purpose. Prior to 2009, a procedure existed in the Airbus A330 documentation that allowed a specific use of manual thrust in difficult environmental conditions. Airbus advised that after an analysis of in-service events the procedure was removed from all operational documents. 
Manipulation of the thrust levers in this manner had the effect of disengaging the autothrottle thereby inhibiting some of the available auto flight system protections including the target speed function (which automatically maintained the desired speed and adjusted for fluctuation in the wind), and the vertical speed reduction function.
It also caused a pitch up tendency which usually requires a large nose down input by the pilot flying to prevent the aircraft from pitching up. At this stage in the approach applying large nose down inputs differed from the gradual nose up input normally required to complete the flare.
Furthermore, it resulted in breaking down of the shared mental model between the pilot flying and pilot monitoring in that the pilot monitoring believed the advancement of the thrust levers was the initiation of a go-around.
Shortly after this action, the aircraft touched down at a vertical speed of approximately 700 feet per minute and a vertical acceleration of 2.61 G was recorded. The aircraft also touched down at approximately 170m (560 feet) from the landing threshold, short of the normal touchdown zone of between 304m (1000 feet) and 609m (2000 feet).
The manufacturer of the aircraft produced a complete load analysis of the event based on recorded flight data provided by the operator. The conclusion of this analysis was that several components in the left and right gear had ""exceeded their design load limits and may have been detrimentally overloaded"".
There were no injuries reported as a result of the hard landing.
The airplane remained at Melbourne until March 26, when it was ferried at low altitude to Darwin, Australia, and continuing to Kuala Lumpur the next day for further repairs.";07:52;Airbus A330-343;Malaysia Airlines;Saturday 14 March 2015

The pilot reported that while on the base leg, the annunciator light for the ""low pitch stop"" propeller system on the right side illuminated. The pilot pulled the circuit breaker and left it out, as per the pilot operating handbook (POH). During the landing-roll, the pilot encountered a severe yaw to the right. The pilot added power to the right engine and realigned the airplane down the centerline. He then applied brakes and reverse thrust. The pilot stated that "" it felt like I had no braking action and then felt the right side grab and brake, but not the left."" The combination of right side braking and the right low pitch system malfunction caused considerable adverse yaw, jerking the plane to the right. The pilot applied power again and straightened the nose of the airplane. He then made the decision to go around, but at this point did not have adequate airspeed or runway length to safely accomplish a go around. He applied the brakes again, and the airplane immediately yawed to the right again, at which time the pilot was unable to compensate before the airplane caught the edge of the runway. The airplane went into the grass, where the pilot attempted to control the direction of the airplane and bring it to a complete stop.

The captain then instructed the co-pilot to execute a go-around, after which he informed the Tower controller. The aircraft began to climb, reaching an altitude of 450 feet above ground level. The Airbus then nosed down, causing the captain to take priority over the flight controls by pushing on priority button and the aircraft was fully under the captain's control who applied a sharp nose down input. The captain did not verbally state that he was taking control. He applied a pitch-up and a pitch-down input on his stick until the airplane impacted the ground.

One passenger survived the accident.

Runway 09 does not have an ILS. Only a Locator approach is available.

The captain supervised the fueling and the weight and balance computations, while the first officer filled out the takeoff and landing distance (TOLD) card; a center of gravity (CG) location was not computed. The first officer entered a takeoff gross weight of 45,400 pounds on the TOLD card, with the V-speeds for that weight entered on the card (V1 116 knots and Vr 129 knots). Post accident calculations revealed that the actual gross takeoff weight was 46,481 pounds and the CG was 15.73% of mean aerodynamic chord (MAC), which was within the maximum gross takeoff weight and center of gravity limits of 46,500 pounds and 14 to 31% MAC, respectively. The V-speeds for the actual gross weight are V1 118 knots and Vr 131 knots. The crew set the stabilizer trim at -5.5 degrees, which is in the takeoff range, from -4.5 degrees to -7.5 degrees. For the airplane’s calculated CG of 15.73% MAC, the right setting for the stabilizer trim should have been between -7 and -7.5 degrees. The captain said that everything was normal in the takeoff. The first officer called V1, followed by Vr, at which time he pulled back on the yoke, but with no response. When the speed was well into the upper 130-knot range he relaxed the yoke, then pulled aft again, and again there was no response from the airplane. Power was then immediately reduced to the stops, full nose forward pressure was applied to the yoke, and maximum braking effort was applied. The airplane departed the end of runway 25 just to the right of centerline. After exiting the end of the runway the airplane impacted a berm, which resulted in the nose landing gear collapsing rearward and the airplane sliding on its nose before coming to a stop about 100 yards off the end of the runway into the dirt.";14:15;Dassault Falcon 900;null;Sunday 10 June 2007

One of the six occupants was injured.
The flight took off from Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, Finland at 09:46 local time. The flight was uneventful until 10:14 hours, 9.5 nm from Tallinn runway 26. When the power levers were retarded to flight idle the crew noticed engine vibration and smelled a smoke in the cockpit. The engine chip detector indicator in the cockpit was lit. After a short discussion about which engine should be shut down the flight engineer shut down the left engine and the captain tried to start the APU to gain more thrust.
During the approach the air traffic controller noticed the aircraft deviating from the approach path to the left and notified the crew. The crew was unable to maintain a proper approach path both in lateral and vertical dimensions. The attempts to start the APU engine failed. Visual contact with the runway was established 0.5 nm from the threshold. The aircraft crossed the airport boundary being not configured for landing and with an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 295-300 km/h. The flaps were extended for 10° over the threshold; the landing gear was lowered after passing the runway threshold and retracted again.
The aircraft made a high speed low pass over the runway at an altitude of ca 10-15 feet with the landing gear traveling down and up again. Flaps were extended over the runway. At the end of the runway full power on the right engine was selected, and the aircraft climbed 15-20 feet and started turning left. The crew started retracting flaps and lowered the landing gear. The aircraft crossed the highway at the end of the runway at ca 30 feet, then descended again, colliding with treetops at the lake shore and made a crash-landing on the snow and ice-covered lake waterline. Due to the thick ice the aircraft remained on the ice and slid 151 m on the ice with heading 238° before coming to a full stop.
After the impact the flight engineer shoot down the right engine and power and released all engine fire extinguishers. All persons onboard escaped immediately through the main door. No emergency was declared and despite suggestions from first officer, a go-around was not formally commanded.

They were then scheduled to return, with passengers, to London-Gatwick Airport (LGW).
An onboard hand-held Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) HP iPAQ computer was used to calculate the takeoff performance data. Once this was completed, the EFB was placed in the standby mode. The flight
to Chambery was uneventful and the aircraft landed at 09:15, 15 minutes behind schedule.
The return flight to Gatwick was scheduled to depart at 10:00. The pre-flight preparations proceeded normally and the pilots reported no distractions other than those normally experienced during a turnaround. The co-pilot, who was the non-handling pilot for this flight, completed the manual load sheet whilst the commander programmed the route into the Flight Management Computer (FMC). The commander reported that he then cross-checked the load sheet information and, having ensured it was correct, entered the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) into the FMC. The FMC then calculated the Takeoff Weight (TOW) using the fuel weight automatically retained in the system. The commander read back the FMC calculated TOW to the co-pilot, who cross-checked it against the load sheet data and confirmed that they agreed.
Having loaded the ZFW into the FMC and cross-checked the TOW, the commander used the EFB computer to calculate the takeoff performance data. This involved waking up the EFB from the standby mode, then entering the airfield, weather and aircraft data, which included the flap position for takeoff. A specific flap setting could be entered, or the computer could be used to provide an optimum setting. The commander stated that he normally entered Flap 5 for the takeoff performance calculation. However, at airports where performance was considered to be more critical, he would set the performance computer to select the optimum setting. As the runway at Chambery is relatively short, the commander chose the optimum flap position calculated by the performance computer. This gave a selection of Flap 1 which, under the circumstances, he did not consider unusual. Similarly, the computed takeoff speeds did not seem unusual to the commander, particularly as they were predicated on a flap setting he did not normally use.
The computed figures, based on the data entered on the EFB, allowed for a reduced thrust takeoff. The calculated assumed temperature to be set to achieve this did not seem unreasonable at the time, although the commander stated that, in hindsight, he considered it to be too high for the airfield and the prevailing conditions.
Both pilots stated that they would normally cross-check the performance figures once they had been calculated on the EFB. However, on this occasion, and for reasons the pilots could not recall, this was not done. The commander wrote the speeds he had computed using the EFB on the flight paperwork and then entered them into the FMC, overwriting the FMC generated speeds. The commander stated that this was standard practice and on this occasion he did not take note of any difference between the two sets of speeds. The rest of the pre-flight preparation was completed and the aircraft took off from runway 36 at Chambery at 10:08 UTC (12:08 local time), on schedule, with 131 passengers onboard. The pilots reported the weather at the time was good, with a light wind from the east, good visibility and dry conditions. The ATIS reported a temperature of 8°C and a QNH of 999 hPa.
On takeoff both pilots felt a slight judder, which they considered was due to turbulence from the preceding aircraft. Early in the climb they received a call on the intercom from the rear cabin station informing them that the cabin crew to the rear of the aircraft had also felt a judder. This call was intended for the cabin purser at the front of the cabin, but was mistakenly made to the flight deck. The pilots reassured the cabin crew member, still believing the judder was due to turbulence. Their opinion was reinforced by the absence of any abnormal flight deck indications or calls from ATC at Chambery to the contrary.
The remainder of the flight went without incident and the aircraft landed at Gatwick at 11:30. The aircraft was taxied to stand and, after shutting down, the pilots were informed by ground personnel that the underside of the rear fuselage had sustained damage consistent with a tailstrike. This prompted the crew to reconsider the cause of the judder felt at takeoff and they reviewed the takeoff performance data. This revealed that the commander had omitted to enter the aircraft's TOW into the EFB computer at Chambery, with the result that the computer had reverted to the previous TOW data retained from Stansted to calculate the takeoff performance figures.";12:08;Boeing 737-33A (QC);Titan Airways;Saturday 14 April 2012

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. One passenger was seriously injured, and one person inside the building received minor injuries. 
The accident flight departed the Bedford-Hanscom Field, MA (BED) at 07:00, and flew to New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA) with only the pilot and pilot-rated passenger onboard. At LaGuardia, five additional passengers boarded the airplane, which subsequently departed on an IFR flight plan to Bedford. While en route, the crew amended the destination to Fitchburg. According to the surviving passenger, the intent was to drop off two passengers at Fitchburg, then continue on to the Martha's Vineyard Airport, MA (MVY), with the remaining passengers.
While on approach to Fitchburg Airport, the airplane entered a left turn, which the surviving passenger described as ""almost completely upside down."" The airplane briefly levelled, then entered another left turn with a bank angle of the same severity. The airplane seemed to roll level, then entered a steep dive, until it impacted a building. The passenger reported that the engines were running normally throughout the entire flight, and the steep turns performed by the pilot did not concern her, as she had flown with him before and knew he ""liked to make sharp turns."" Examination of the airplane and engines revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies, and weather at the time of the accident included a broken cloud ceiling of 1,100 feet, with 3 miles visibility in mist.
 Toxicology testing performed on the pilot revealed imipramine and carbamazepine in the pilot's urine and blood, and morphine in the pilot's urine. According to the pilot's medical and pharmacy records, he suffered from a severe neurological disorder, possibly a seizure disorder, which resulted in frequent, unpredictable episodes of debilitating pain. Additionally, approximately three months prior to the accident, the pilot was diagnosed with viral meningitis, and a severe skin infection with multiple abscesses on his extremities. The pilot had been prescribed imipramine, an antidepressant that has detrimental effects on driving skills and other cognitive functions. He had also been prescribed carbamazepine, typically used to control seizures or treat certain chronically painful conditions. Carbamazepine has measurable impairment of performance on a variety of psychomotor tests. Morphine, a prescription opiate painkiller, is also a metabolite of heroin and many prescription medications, such as codeine, used to control moderate pain. No indication was observed in the pilot's medical records that he was recently prescribed any opiates. Neither the pilot's medical condition, nor the medication he was routinely taking was reported on his application for an airman medical certificate.";09:35;Beechcraft B200 King Air;FS Corsair Inc;Friday 4 April 2003

The en route part of the flight was uneventful.
The flight crew established radio contact with Düsseldorf Radar at 05:43. The crew were told that runway 23L was in use. 
Two minutes later the radar controller contacted flight 8995: ""I just talked to the tower and ah for the time being braking action on all parts of the runway is supposed to be good. They are measuring again right now because it started to snow again and I'll keep you advised."" The flight was then cleared to descend to FL80. The flight crew decided to set the autobrakes for landing on Medium, to account for the snow.
At 05:50 the radar controller again contacted the flight about the current weather circumstances: ""...latest update on the weather situation ahm the friction tester has reported braking action to be good for the moment however as its continuing to snow they are ah afraid that it might worsen, so they are going to do another friction test right before you land.""
In the following minutes the flight was given descent instructions and vectors for an approach to runway 23L.
At 05:54 the controller radioed: ""weather update we now have a surface wind of three four zero degrees eleven knots, that's slight tail wind component by two knots. Visibility is down to one thousand five hundred meters, still in snow showers and ah cloud base is now five hundred feet only.""
The flight was subsequently cleared for the approach.
At 05:57 the radar controller instructed the crew to contact Düsseldorf Tower. The Tower controller stated: ""Good morning,... we are just waiting for the braking action values from the friction tester stand by a second. The surface wind is actually three three zero degrees one two knots.""
Two minutes later the controller radioed: ""... the braking action was measured to be medium at all parts. And ah the visibility dropped right now due to the heavy snow showers at the field ah. The RVR value at the touch down zone is presently nine hundred meters, at the mid-point one thousand one hundred meters and ah stop end one thousand one hundred meters."" At that moment the flight was 3,5 nautical miles out. The flight was subsequently cleared to land.
The airplane touched down about 1700 ft (518 m) past the runway threshold. Ground spoilers and thrust reversers deployed and the autobrakes activated. Still the airplane did not decelerate as expected and the pilot applied manual braking. The airplane failed to stop and overran the runway end. It collided with ILS aerials, which caused a fire in engines no. 2 and no. 3.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and there were no reported injuries among the 6 crew and 87 passengers onboard.
The aircraft departed Quito at 06:51 hours local time. 
During the landing preparation briefing, at 07:34, the pilot indicated that they would hold the glide slope until they had a runway in sight, inhibit the glide slope alarm, and continue visual. Four minutes later the flight was cleared for the VOR ILS ZULU approach for runway 23. The runway was wet due to drizzle and the braking efficiency reported by an Airbus A319 was good to average. The A319 had landed on the runway in Cuenca 36 minutes before flight 173. 
At 07:46, the flight radioed that they were ten miles out and established on the localizer. They were cleared to the ILS approach for runway 23. Three minutes later the controller reported that they had flight 173 in sight and informed that the wind was calm, and cleared the flight to land on runway 23. T
At 07:50, the pilot indicated that he had three red and one white lights on the PAPI system.  The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 37 feet high instead of 50 feet, which meant the aircraft approached below the normal glidepath. It touched down 277 m past the threshold at an airspeed of 127 knots. Spoilers were deployed 585 meters from the threshold, followed by reverses at 643 m.
The pilot, not feeling an effective braking of the aircraft, tried to activate the autobrake system but this did not work. The aircraft was hydroplaning and could not be brought to a halt on the runway. The pilot groundlooped the aircraft on the grass.

Runway 23 is a 1900 m long runway with an upslope of 15 m (+0.78%). Distance from the centre of the end of the paved runway to the boundary fence and an active road is 31 m.	The Operational Landing Distance calculations with manual braking for the weight of the aircraft with wind on touchdown, indicate that a runway length of 2,122 meters was necessary.";07:51;Embraer ERJ 190-100 IGW (ERJ-190AR);TAME Ecuador;Thursday 28 April 2016

The captain, who was the pilot flying and sitting in the right-hand seat, completed a normal takeoff. The flight took off from runway 27, over a lake. About 400 feet above ground level, the captain began a climbing right turn en route. During the turn, she had difficulty seeing the artificial horizon and concentrated on the aircraft's bank angle. The first officer called that the aircraft was in a 2000-feet-per-minute descent and took control. The aircraft struck the frozen surface of the lake, bounced, and became airborne again. The first officer retained control, and the captain attempted to feather the damaged right propeller. The first officer, believing that both propellers had sustained damage, force-landed the aircraft on the lake surface.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan was filed for the flight from Marathon-Florida Keys Airport (MTH), Florida. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airline transport pilot and co-pilot, 1 flight attendant, and 4 passengers were not injured, 1 passenger sustained serious injuries, and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. The flight originated from MTH about 15:54.

The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the landing dry and wet distances were calculated to be 3,166 and 4,166 feet, respectively. The flight departed MTH and while en route they obtained the MKY automated weather observing station (AWOS) which indicated the wind was from 250 degrees at 5 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles.
The PIC further stated they reviewed the speeds (Vref of 133 knots), and planned a visual approach to runway 17. Air traffic control approved their request for a visual approach, and they changed to the common traffic advisory frequency, entering left downwind for runway 17. They slowed, lowered the flaps to 20 degrees, and noted rain 2 to 3 miles east of MKY, though the airport appeared to be dry. When the flight was abeam runway 17, the landing gear was lowered and the flaps were extended to 30 degrees. The landing checklist was performed, and the anti-skid test was normal. The thrust reversers were armed, and he performed a ""teardrop turn"" to final. With flaps at 45 degrees, gear down, and flying Vref plus 10 knots, a couple of gusts were encountered during the approach. The co-pilot checked the AWOS again; the wind was still 250 degrees at 5 knots. He maintained a normal glide path at Vref plus 4 or 5 knots at the runway threshold, where he positioned both thrust levers to idle. The airplane was landed firm about 300 to 500 feet beyond the aiming point marking, and after touchdown he was unable to extend the ground spoilers. When the nose landing gear contacted the runway, he applied ""moderate"" brakes and held the control yoke forward, but felt no deceleration. He also attempted to deploy the thrust reversers but was unable.
The PIC informed the co-pilot there was no braking energy and released the brakes; the anti-skid was turned off and the brakes were re-applied pressing hard. He did not feel any deceleration, and again tried to deploy the thrust reversers, but was unable. He kept the airplane on the runway centerline, and began modulating the brakes. Unable to stop the airplane he added right rudder input causing the airplane to veer to the right. The airplane went off the end of the runway into sand causing the nose landing gear to collapse. After coming to rest he ordered an emergency evacuation, and secured the engines.";16:15;Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 601-3A;Six Hundred NP, LLC;Sunday 1 March 2015

The airplane was registered to the Southwest Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Clinic and operated by Interstate Helicopters.
At the time of the accident, Interstate Helicopters was operating the accident airplane in commercial service contrary to its Federal Aviation Administration-issued 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 operating certificate, which, at the time, did not authorize operation of the accident airplane or any other fixed-wing aircraft.
The Cessna Citation took off from Wiley Post Airport, OK at 15:13 and climbed to an altitude of 3,100 feet while on a southwesterly heading. While in the
airspace near the Lake Overholser dam the airplane started a steep descent. The airplane impacted wooded terrain approximately one mile south of the dam. There were no reported radio calls of distress from the flight crew.
Investigation revealed that departure from controlled flight likely resulted from wing structure damage sustained during an in-flight collision with a flock of American white pelicans, which far exceeded the airframe’s design certification limit.

On board were 33 passengers, 2 pilots, and 1 flight attendant. The first officer was the pilot flying.

The crew briefed for an ILS approach for runway 07 at Ottawa. The aircraft was vectored by ATC to a base leg at approximately 10 nautical miles. At 14:26, ATC advised the crew that the wind was 160° at 10 knots gusting to 16 knots, with a visibility of 10 sm in light rain.
During the final turn to intercept the localizer, the airport controller informed the crew that they were in the process of switching the active runway to runway 14. The crew was given the option of continuing for runway 07 or switching to runway 14. Considering the increased flight time, the extra fuel that would be used to manoeuver the aircraft for runway 14, and the fact that the aircraft was already established on approach to runway 07, the crew elected to continue for runway 07. 
The final approach course was intercepted at 7 nm. The aircraft began its final descent upon interception of the glideslope, at a position approximately 4.7 nm from the threshold, with the autopilot coupled. Nearing the final approach fix, 3.9 nm from the threshold, the landing gear was extended, the landing flaps were selected to 22°, and the autopilot was disconnected. At approximately 1000 feet agl and 2.9 nm from the threshold, the airspeed was stable at 150 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). Shortly thereafter, the windshield wipers were turned on, and the crew indicated that they had the runway in sight.
When the aircraft descended through approach minimums, 200 feet agl and 0.3 nm from the threshold, the airspeed was 144 KIAS. The aircraft crossed the threshold of runway 07 at 49 feet agl, at a speed of 139 KIAS. The aircraft did a very smooth touchdown, and the weight on wheels (WOW) switch momentarily activated at 14:30:15, 1740 feet from threshold. At that point, the nose was still in the air, and the aircraft floated. Two seconds later, 2270 feet from the threshold and at a speed of 132 KIAS, the second WOW activated and the nose wheel came down.
The first officer was depressing the brake pedals during the second WOW activation; all spoilers automatically deployed after the nose wheel was lowered to the ground. The first officer continued to apply brakes until maximum braking was commanded. Sensing a lack of deceleration, the first officer informed the captain, who then took control of the aircraft and applied maximum braking as well. The aircraft could not be slowed during brake application.
The aircraft was on the centreline until approximately 200 feet before the end of the runway, where it veered left. The aircraft exited the paved surface of the runway at approximately 62 KIAS. It continued through the grass for approximately 120 feet, at which point there was a sharp downward change in elevation of about 2 feet. The nose gear collapsed rearward, but the aircraft continued to skid. It came to a rest 550 feet from the end of the runway and 220 feet left of centreline. The flight attendant initiated the evacuation procedure for the passengers.";14:30;Embraer EMB-145LR (ERJ-145LR);null;Wednesday 16 June 2010

N14447, coded ""Tanker 11"", under contract to the US Forest Service, crashed about 20 miles north of Modena, Iron County, Utah, during a fire fighting operation against the White Rock Fire in the Hamblin Valley Area.
Tanker 11 departed the tanker base to conduct its second fire retardant drop of the day in the same location. Upon arriving in the fire traffic area, Tanker 11 followed the lead airplane into the drop zone, which was located in a shallow valley 0.4 mile wide and 350 feet deep. The lead airplane flew a shallow right turn onto final and then dropped to an altitude of 150 feet above the valley floor while approaching the intended drop zone. While making the right turn onto final behind the lead airplane, Tanker 11's right wing tip collided with terrain, which resulted in a rapid right yaw and subsequent impact with terrain. The wreckage created a 1,088-foot-long debris field, and a post impact fire ensued. 
Two witnesses took photographs of the accident sequence photos, and an examination of these photographs showed that the lead airplane was positioned ahead of the tanker throughout the flight; however, the orientation of the lead airplane compared to the orientation of Tanker 11 indicated that Tanker 11 did not directly follow the lead airplane's path to the final drop course. Rather, it was about 700 feet left of the lead airplane's path and made a wider right turn as it attempted to align with the final drop course. The accident flight crewmembers had previously flown nearly the same exact drop and the lead pilot cautioned them about tailwind conditions during the flight; however, the wider turn suggests that they did not properly compensate for the wind conditions while maneuvering. In addition, the previous flight was conducted at an altitude above the ridgeline. GPS evidence indicates that the accident flight was conducted below the ridgeline, which would have made it more difficult to detect the rising terrain during the wider turn. A review of the airplane's cockpit voice recorder audio information revealed that the flight crew did not recognize or attempt to correct the reduced clearance between Tanker 11 and the rising terrain until about 2 seconds before impact.";13:47;Lockheed P-2H Neptune;Neptune Aviation Services;Sunday 3 June 2012

At 16:11 Los Angeles ARTCC asked the condition of the flight and were told that they were troubleshooting a jammed stabilizer. The crew requested, and were granted, a FL200-FL250 block altitude clearance. At 16:15 the crew were handed off to Los Angeles sector control. The Alaska Airlines crew reported problems maintaining their altitude and told their intentions to divert to Los Angeles International Airport. They were cleared to do so at 16:16.

Last message from Flight 261 was when they requested another block altitude. The request was granted at 16:17, without a readback from the crew. During the descent the crew was also talking to Alaska Airlines maintenance personnel in Seattle and Los Angeles to troubleshoot their stabilizer trim problems.

The aircraft operated flight SG1085 from Bangalore to Hubli and departed at around 13:00 UTC. At the time the visibility reported for Hubli was 10 km. 
When the aircraft came in contact with Mangalore ATC, the controller cleared the aircraft direct to Hubli and informed heavy rains and thunder showers over Hubli with visibility 3000 m. At around 60 nm from Hubli, the weather reported was heavy rain and visibility 4000 meters. ATC cleared aircraft for the NDB approach runway 26, however the captain preferred to carry out a VOR/DME trial procedure for runway 26. The descent was commenced and about 25 nm short of Hubli, ATC again advised visibility has reduced to 3000 m due heavy rain and thunderstorm.
Thereafter the crew decided to hold over Hubli until the weather improves. Twenty minutes into holding, ATC again informed that visibility has improved to 4000 m in moderate rain.
Subsequently descent was requested by the pilot for runway 26. The captain stated that he had established visual reference with runway at about 6 nm on the final approach course. The crew also selected wipers on short finals to have a better visibility. The aircraft landed normally. 
The captain stated that after touch down and reducing power, he was concentrating on the far end of the runway. As the runway was wet, he did not realize that the aircraft was drifting to the left of the center line. He further mentioned that he selected full reverse on both the engines to maintain the aircraft on the center line however the aircraft veered toward the left side of the runway and in the process overran the runway edge light, after which the left main landing gear collapsed. The propeller blades hit the runway surface and sheared off from the root attachment. The captain maneuvered the aircraft however the nose wheel tyre failed under over load conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed as well. 
Subsequently, the aircraft exited the runway on the left side on kutcha (dried mud) and came to a final stop at round 52 meters away from the runway center line. The cockpit crew shut down the engines and the electrical power supply and cockpit door and announced evacuation. The cabin crew opened and the cabin doors on the right for evacuation.

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the positioning flight which had departed Boston, Massachusetts, at 16:00.
At dusk, with a 100-foot ceiling in fog, the captain of the Beech 1900D had performed two missed approaches to the airport. On the third approach, both the captain and first officer visually acquired the runway. The first officer said the captain lined the airplane up with the runway centerline and requested landing flaps. The first officer further stated, '...the aircraft floated at appr. 20' [feet] over the runway at a normal transition when I heard the captain taking the power levers over the 'FI [flight idle] gate' by the sound of the engine/props.' This placed the propellers in the 'BETA' range. The airplane then started to sink, and the captain pulled back on the control yoke. The main landing gear struck the ground and were fractured during the +2.9G touchdown, which occurred about 2,500 feet beyond the approach end of the 5,252 foot long runway. The airplane departed the right side of the runway, about 4,700 feet beyond the approach end, and stopped. To place the throttles in BETA, it was necessary to lift the power levers over the flight idle stop.";17:19;Beechcraft 1900D;Colgan Air;Friday 22 January 1999

In Ankara the airplane was loaded with 39980 kg of cargo. The next stop was Baku, Azerbaijan for refueling. The airplane took 47 tons of fuel, bringing the takeoff weight to 189 tons, and the centre of gravity to 29,3% MAC, which was within the prescribed limits. During the eight-hour stopover the crew decided to rest in the aircraft instead of a hotel. As the aircraft started taxiing to the runway the flight engineer was heard saying that he would select the flaps at 30 degrees and slats at 14 degrees for takeoff. This however was not done. Prior to takeoff the position of the flaps was not verified by any of the crew members. Takeoff was thus commenced with flaps and slats retracted and the stabilizer trimmed at the takeoff position -4 degrees (corresponding to actual takeoff weight, CofG and flaps at 30°). At a speed of 210 km/h the pilot pulled on the control column to lift off the nose gear. At a calculated unstick speed of 265 km/h the angle of attack reached 9 degrees but the plane did not lift off the runway. Accelerating through 290 km/h the angle of attack of the aircraft reached 14,5 degrees, setting off the angle of attack warning on the flight deck. Some 1750 meters down the runway, the aft fuselage struck the runway. Seventy meters further on, at a speed of 300 km/h and an angle of attack of 19,4°, the Ilyushin lifted off the runway. The air traffic controller who witnessed the departure advised the crew to abort the takeoff, but the captain apparently continued. The airplane rolled to the left until the wing contacted the runway. Then the flight engineer noted his error and, without informing the captain, began extending the flaps and slats. Again without informing the captain, the flight engineer brought back the power levers of the four engines to idle. After three seconds he moved them from idle to the 'engine shutdown' position. The captain three times yelled ""takeoff"" but the engines were already shut down. After flying for 490 meters the aircraft struck the ground and crashed.";ca 09:40;Ilyushin 76MD;Azov-Avia Airlines;Thursday 4 March 2004

The pilot advised the tower controller that he would be able to taxi off runway 25L at the A2 taxiway. The local controller instructed the Beech 99 to ""turn right alpha two and ah monitor ground point eight and taxi to the cargo ramp."" The Beech pilot reported that he slowed to taxi speed, turned off the strobes and landing light and deice equipment, turned onto taxiway A2 and reached for the radio to tune ground. He then heard a thump, and saw the no. 2 engine engulfed in flame. He reported that he thought he had an engine fire so he shut off the firewall shutoff valve. The fire continued to spread on the right side of the airplane, so he shut down the left engine and began to evacuate the airplane. Cargo blocked the cargo exit door and the fuselage emergency exit, so he egressed through the cockpit crew window.

The pilot, who was the sole occupant was not injured. 
The aircraft took off from Tokyo-Haneda Airport at 14:41 local time on a ferry flight to Konan Airfield. 
The pilot switched from IFR to Visual Flight Rules (VFR) at about 15nm short of Kibi VOR. The aircraft passed over the vicinity of Saidaiji (the published visual reporting point, 6.7 nm northeast from the airfield) at an altitude of about 3,000 ft and a speed of about 200 kt at 15:41, and acquired information on the active runway and wind condition from Konan Flight Service.
This was reported as runway 09, with a wind direction 090° at 5 kts, and the aircraft was requested to report on the left downwind leg. 
The captain remembered the wind condition being 4 kts from the south, and assessed both runway directions to be available. He thus requested to land using runway 27, which was a shorter flight path, and was requested to report at 2 nm short of runway 27 or on the base leg.
The aircraft was configured for landing and at 15:44:59 the aircraft descended through 500 feet.
The captain stated that he made straight-in approach at 117 kt, adding 10 kt as usual above the VREF displayed on the speed indicator to avoid stalling. According to EGPWS records, there was a warning ""Too Low, Flaps"" at 15:45:11 when the aircraft was at 205 ft AGL, with an airspeed 155 kt and ground speed 160 kt. This voice warning was repeated two times.
EGPWS records showed the aircraft gradually reduced speed on the final approach, with the last record being at 87 ft AGL with an airspeed 142 kt and ground speed 147 kt.
The main landing gears of the aircraft touched down forward of the aiming point marking. About half way down the runway the pilot noticed a bird and turned a little bit to the right to avoid the bird, which was flying away. The captain then strongly applied the brakes, but he did not feel the usual deceleration. Continuing to apply the brakes, the aircraft avoided the stopway edge lights to the right and entered a grass area; accordingly, it went into a pond used as a regulating reservoir located west of the runway at about 20 to 30 kts. 

Konan Airport is former Okayama Airport (OKJ/RJOB) with a single runway 09/27 measuring 1200 m x 30 m (20 m grooving) and 0 ft elevation. After opening of new Okayama Airport in 1988, the airport was renamed as Konan Airport and is used for general aviation.";15:46;Cessna 525A CitationJet CJ2+;Auto Panther;Wednesday 10 June 2015
